"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday suggested that the Taliban should be given incentives to handle the current situation instead of being forced to do something and claimed it would be a ""fallacy"" to think that Afghanistan could be controlled from outside.

""So rather than sitting here and thinking that we can control them, we should incentivise them because this current government in Afghanistan clearly feels that without international aid and help they will not be able to stop this crisis. We should push them in the right direction,” he said. Read more"

Now Reading:
"Your skincare routine is always incomplete without a hydrating and moisturising face cream. Face creams are a compulsory thing in the beauty market today. Beauty influencers and doctors recommend people opt for a lightweight and hydrating face cream keeping away from acne and dry skin issues as it perfectly blends with your skin and should be a staple in your beauty regime. To get a hydrating and moisturising glow, the best face cream for you should be the mixture of aloe vera and kesar and should be applied every day."
"You need to have fresh and natural saffron strands and infuse them in warm water to release their essence. Let them cool down, and now in a clean bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, 1 tablespoon of almond oil, and 2 vitamin E capsules. Now mix them well. Gradually add the saffron-infused water along with 1 tablespoon of rose water, and blend until you have achieved a smooth and creamy consistency. Now, transfer this mixture into an airtight container and start the application."

"If you wish to achieve a naturally radiant complexion, then start applying this cream at night and let it seep into your skin. This also diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, saying goodbye to pesky dark spots, and also combats visible signs of ageing for a youthful and revitalized look. Apply this cream on your face and neck before bedtime for a freshly cleansed face. Also, keep this in your fridge for up to two weeks complete the application within the given time lab, and start with another batch."

Women who are pregnant or in the process of breastfeeding should not use saffron, as when used with supplements, saffrons may cause problems for people having blood pressure medicines or dealing with blood thinners as well. Saffron also may lower the oestrogen level in women, but these claims are not scientifically sound yet."

"""Big win for our constitution and democracy. Proud to be an American,"" Donald Trump posted on Truth Social as his first reaction after the verdict. For Trump camp, the verdict is a relief because he is now unlikely to face any trial before the November 5 election."
"Nielsen data shows over 51 million TV viewers watched the US presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, marking a 30% drop from 2020's initial debate. The new format, including microphone muting and no audience, drew mixed reviews. Despite criticism for lack of real-time fact-checking, CNN defended its approach, emphasizing question facilitation over immediate fact verification."
"During a heated presidential debate, democratic nominee Joe Biden criticized republican challenger Donald Trump for criminal convictions, including fabricating business documents and accusations of sexual assault. Trump denied allegations and countered by mentioning Biden's son, Hunter. Both candidates traded personal attacks as they clashed over legal issues and military remarks."
"Most skilled graduates who are most thoroughly vetted will be eligible for Donald Trump's automatic Green Card promise, if he becomes the president. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges will be excluded. ​Donald Trump did not set a good precedent on immigration earlier. He began his presidency by banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and later embraced a proposal to cut legal immigration by half."
"​""Bill Maher, the highly overrated “Star” of the ratings challenged show with the Fake, Loud and Obnoxious laughter pouring out of your set every few seconds, even when nothing was said that was funny (which is most of the time!), suffers from a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, sometimes referred to as TDS. Republicans should stop using him as a reference point, his show is dead!"" Donald Trump wrote."
"US President Joe Biden, 81, and his Republican rival Donald Trump, 78, the oldest presidential candidates in America's political history, addressed concerns about their age in a Thursday faceoff ahead of the general election. Neither offered a clear answer on how they would handle the rigors of another four-year term if re-elected. Biden, who has faced scrutiny over his mental and physical acuity, briefly touched on the issue before changing the subject."
"Apple's Tim Cook was one of the titans present at a business roundtable meeting where Donald Trump talked about finding ways to keep US-educated talent at home. The tech and business leaders supported Trump's idea and days after the roundtable, Trump, in a podcast, said that he would give automatic Green Cards to foreign students graduating in US, if elected to power."
"Donald Trump's spontaneous style could reintroduce volatility to financial markets, which is favorable for a specific group of fast-money traders who excel in such conditions. With Trump and President Joe Biden closely matched ahead of their first debate, investors are speculating how Trump's potential return to the White House could impact various sectors, from the electric vehicle industry to long-term interest rates. While markets generally dislike uncertainty, certain hedge funds benefit from the significant swings and price anomalies it creates."
"Dr Anthony Fauci said his equation with Donald Trump was complicated. Initially they got along very well -- Fauci from Queens, Trump from New York -- but then Trump started to say incorrect things. Fauci said he had to contradict Trump publicly though he was not comfortable doing so. In Fauci's autobiography “On Call: A Doctor’s Journey in Public Service”, the chapter on Donald Trump is titled 'He loves me, he loves me not'."
"Fauci in his memoir recollected the last phone call with Donald Trump in 2020 November, two days before the election. US was battling the Covid pandemic and Donald Trump did not like Fauci's cautionary interview to the Washington Post. In that interview, Fauci actually said that Joe Biden's campaigning was taking Covid-19 seriously while Trump's rallies were packed with maskless men and women."
"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's wife Melania Trump has reportedly made a deal with him regarding her role if he returns to the White House. According to a Trumpworld insider cited by Page Six, Melania will not be on first lady duty 24/7. It has been reported that Melania is planning to spend part of every month, likely every week, in New York City. This decision is linked to their son Barron Trump's expected university attendance in the city."
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle moved to the US in 2020 but in a memoir published three years later, Harry admitted to have taken drugs, mushrooms, marijuana. In US, a drug abuser is not granted visa. The Heritage Foundation, a think tank, sought to know whether Harry lied on the visa form or whether he was given any preferential treatment."
"Joe Biden's campaign has dropped the first television ad for his presidential campaign. ""This election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family,"" the ad titled 'Character Matters' said. The ad comes just 10 days before Biden and Trump are scheduled for their first face off to be hosted by CNN on June 27."
"​All eyes are on Melania Trump as she is nowhere to be seen at Trump's campaign. She also missed the presidential debate. This was not the scene in 2016 and 2020. Reports claim Melania has made a deal with Trump that if he wins the presidency, she will not be the 24X7 first lady, She will be in the White House only on occasions -- and the rest of the time she will spend with their son Barron Trump who may join New York University in the fall."
"The US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that former President Trump has “absolute” immunity for official acts, raising concerns about an imperial presidency. The decision, split along conservative-liberal lines, sends Trump’s election interference case back to lower courts, likely delaying it until after the 2024 election. If Trump wins, he can quash the case; if Biden wins, he might gain similar powers. The ruling could reshape presidential immunity, with critics arguing it undermines the principle that no one is above the law."
"President Joe Biden's family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Biden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention."
"The Biden campaign has emailed supporters advising them on how to counter criticisms of President Biden's debate performance. Despite widespread criticism, the email reaffirms Biden as the Democratic nominee and warns against calls for his replacement, arguing it would disrupt the party and benefit Trump. It stresses Biden's electoral mandate and financial preparedness for the general election."

"Tigers are handsome, majestic and also endangered. These grand creatures roam across select regions of the world but India is proud to be home to the largest population. Places like Ranthambore and Bandhavgarh are known for their population of tigers. Russia's Amur tigers thrive in the vast forests of the Far East while Indonesia shelters Sumatran tigers in its dense rainforests. Nepal too protects tigers in Chitwan and Bardia National Parks and Malaysia's Malayan tigers roam the Malay Peninsula. Bangladesh also hosts Royal Bengal tigers in its mangrove forests.On this note, let’s have a look at countries with the maximum tiger population."
"India leads the world with an impressive 3,167 tigers according to the latest 2022 census. The country is renowned for its expansive national parks like Ranthambore, Jim Corbett, and Bandhavgarh, where tigers roam freely. India is also a global leader in wild tiger conservation efforts."
"Russia's tiger population is estimated to be between 480 and 540, primarily comprising the majestic Amur tigers. These Siberian tigers thrive in the vast forests of the Russian Far East, known for their grace, beauty, and grandeur."
"Indonesia is known for its population of Sumatran tigers. There are some 371 Sumatran tigers living in Indonesia. These critically endangered subspecies are confined to the island of Sumatra. Amidst the lush rainforests and protected reserves, these elusive cats are threatened by human encroachment."
"Nepal too is celebrated for its tiger conservation initiatives. The country is home to 355 tigers within its national parks and sanctuaries, including Chitwan and Bardia. These efforts underscore Nepal's commitment to safeguarding its rich biodiversity."
"Malaysia hosts 120 Malayan tigers. These are predominantly found in the southern and central regions of the Malay Peninsula. Despite habitat fragmentation and poaching threats, conservation efforts continue to sustain these rare felines."
Bangladesh remains an important stronghold for the Royal Bengal tigers. There are approximately 106 tigers living in its dense mangrove forests and protected reserves. Efforts to mitigate human-wildlife conflict and ensure habitat connectivity are crucial to their survival.
Thailand shelters between 148 to 149 Indochinese tigers. These symbolise Southeast Asia's rich biodiversity. The tigers living within protected areas like Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary face threats from illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss.

Movie is very good.
"How come there's no Muslim person involved in the cast and crew. The movie is solely revolving around the religion but not any Muslim involved. This shows how biased the content is and a belief heard from society has been served as truth of Islam. Literally, there isn't any full verse from the Quran or Hadith narrated and some are just put by themselves which cannot be found in any book of Islam. The movie story is like a Western who haven't left his country ever writing about Eastern culture."
"The Qur'anic verse has been misrepresented and misconstrued and the Muslim community has been targeted while there are many people in the Hindu religion who have eight, eight and ten children."
Good movie that shows the challenges of a patriarchal society.

Now Reading:
"Lord Hanuman, the one who is a devotee before being a God, is one of the most powerful, and full of wisdom. Lord Hanuman is known to be the epitome of devotion, courage, and selfless service, and it was all evident during the Ramayana where he went above and beyond to serve Lord Ram.Today, people from all over the world worship him for his attributes. Plus, it is also believed that Lord Hanuman is always listening to his bhakts, removing obstacles, granting strength, and providing protection from evil."
"It is said and believed that to please Lord Hanuman is the easiest. He is happy and content with pure devotion to him and to Lord Ram. And so, to receive his blessings, his devotees do the most simple tasks. For example, reading the Hanuman Chalisa, maintaining celibacy as he was a Brahmachary, fasting on Tuesdays, doing Ram jap, and the likes."
"The Hanuman Chalisa, written by Tulsidas ji, is a forty-verse hymn that talks about and praises the virtues and deeds of Lord Hanuman. It is one of the most powerful and sacred prayers dedicated to Lord Hanuman and the different verses are the different attributes of him. From his ability to fight off evil to his blessing of retrieving the Sanjivani for Lakshman, it is the Hanuman Chalisa that packs it all in one simple book.But often, when people are in a rush or they do not have a Guru to teach them how to pronounce it right, they tend to skip words, mispronounce them, or just not know the right meanings.Here are a few things that should be kept in mind when reciting the Hanuman Chalisa."
"One of the first things to do is to begin by sitting in a comfortable and meditative posture. Sit with your legs crossed, your hands in front of you, your spine straight, and your mind having an image of Lord Hanuman.This posture and visualisiations will help you focus your mind so that distractions don't come in your way and the image of Lord Hanuman in your head will help channel the energy towards the prayer."
"Before the starting of the chaupai, there is one Doha and then one at the end. The starting one says ‘Shri Guru Charan Saroj Raj..’ and the one at the conclusion says ‘Pawan Tanaya Sankat Haran..’, one should make sure that they never skip reciting the two dohas from the Chalisa. The two dohas invoke the power and blessings of Lord Hanuman and thus should never be skipped."
"People prefer to chant the Hanuman Chalisa or any other shloka or mantra in their mind. And while the silent recitation is good when it comes to keeping the mind focused, Hanuman Chalisa should not be recited inwardly. As mentioned in the Chalisa, it is a ‘Paath’. And a paath should be read aloud while feeling the vibrations and the energy that it emits.So, whenever chanting the Hanuman chalisa, make sure to read it aloud or play it on your speaker or phone in a volume that you’ll be able to hear it loud and clear and the positivity will surround you."
"In the daily hustle and grind, the time we give to God is very limited. And so, most people only chant the Chalisa once or twice. But, it is said that Hanuman Chalisa should be chanted more times. As the Chalisa says ‘Jo shat baar paath kare koi, chhuthi bandhi Mahasukh hoi’. Which means, the person who chants the Hanuman Chalisa 100 times will be rid of any bondages and problems and will receive immense happiness."
"As we read, memorise, and keep reciting the same words and sentences over and over, we usually do not focus on the meanings. And so, Guru Rambhadracharya ji had given a very important point to keep in mind, some years ago. He had said that while reciting the Chalisa, the name of Tulsidas ji should be replaced with your own name. The chaupai that states ‘Tulsidas sada hari chera’, should be replaced with the chanter’s name."

"Parenting is a journey filled with joy, challenges, and constant learning. While every mother strives to do her best, mistakes are inevitable. Here are ten common parenting mistakes that every mother should learn from to ensure the holistic development and well-being of her children."
Canva
Why It Matters: Overprotective parenting can hinder a child’s ability to develop independence and problem-solving skills.How to Avoid: Allow your child to experience and navigate challenges on their own. Offer guidance but let them make decisions and learn from their mistakes.
Canva
Why It Matters: Inconsistent discipline can confuse children and lead to behavioral issues.How to Avoid: Set clear rules and consequences. Be consistent in enforcing them and ensure that both parents are on the same page.
Canva
Why It Matters: Comparing your child to others can damage their self-esteem and create unnecessary pressure.How to Avoid: Focus on your child's individual strengths and progress. Celebrate their unique qualities and achievements.
Canva
"Why It Matters: Mothers who neglect their own well-being can become stressed and less effective in their parenting role.How to Avoid: Make time for self-care activities, whether it’s exercising, reading, or spending time with friends. A happy, healthy mother is better equipped to care for her children."
Canva
"Why It Matters: Failing to listen to your child can make them feel undervalued and ignored.How to Avoid: Practice active listening. Show genuine interest in their thoughts and feelings, and validate their emotions."
Canva
Why It Matters: Overindulging children can lead to entitlement and lack of gratitude.How to Avoid: Set limits on material possessions and privileges. Teach your child the value of hard work and earning rewards.
Canva
Why It Matters: Emotional neglect can affect a child’s mental health and relationships.How to Avoid: Be emotionally available. Provide a supportive environment where your child feels safe to express their feelings.
Canva
Why It Matters: Setting unrealistic expectations can cause stress and anxiety in children.How to Avoid: Set achievable goals based on your child’s abilities and interests. Encourage effort and progress rather than perfection.
Canva
"Why It Matters: Not spending enough quality time can weaken the parent-child bond.How to Avoid: Dedicate regular, undistracted time to engage in activities your child enjoys. Build memories through shared experiences."
Canva
"Why It Matters: Avoiding difficult topics can leave children unprepared for real-world challenges.How to Avoid: Have open, honest discussions about topics like sex, drugs, and mental health. Equip your child with the knowledge to make informed decisions."

"Kalki 2898 AD<br/>Hats off to Nag Ashwin, for conceiving, creating the Kalki universe. A spectacular show, though first half is dragging but second half compensated it completely.<br/><br/>Casting.<br/>After the disastrous Adi Purush, Prabhas back with bang. <br/>Amithab no words to express his towering screen presence, mind blowing.<br/>Deepika will never regret donning the role of Maa<br/>Shobhna, Samuthrakani, Sawsata all have done terrific job. Anil George, Lala of Mirzapur and Anna Ben surprises.<br/>Kamal has limited screen time but he never disappoints, ferociously covered his part.<br/>And there are many characters, casting directors has put everything and pulled it off stunningly.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/>Glimpses of Mahabharata, wow, goose bumps when Karna takes Arjun and assures Ashwatma that his friends can defend him.<br/>I am 101% sure that if any industry that can bring out the Mahabharata on grand scale and without compromising our culture and tradition is Telugu Industry. I hope Rajamouli Garu and Nag Ashwin Garu should collaborate to bring this epic saga to screen.<br/><br/>Many more, but don’t want to spill out many things here, haan, don’t wait Kal ke Liye, watch this movie today!!!"
"The movie Kalki deserves Zero stars <br/>for hurting sentiments with showing wrong facts (Fight scene of Krishna and Aswathama and Krishna taking forehead manni which was actually taken by Arjun and Bhim) keeps revolving much around meaningless drama, lovestory, silly street fights, All characters chanting Units ...units and Complex.... Complex forgetting the core of Mahabharata and useless flying scooters made a commedy.<br/>It would have been nice if some more actual scene of Mahabharata with some Geeta Gyan and Sri Krishna shown as Virat roop rather mockery of actual scene with showing women as objects required only for serum and baby birth by some useless ganju baba named supreme...horrible <br/>Actual content, about Kalki is just 25%...Only few Scenes from Mahabharata are truly nice, a few scene with Amitabh Bacchan as  ashwathama are good which makes some sence. Otherwise sort of ruined the whole concept, and senseless comedy"

"Varalaxmi, daughter of renowned actor Sarathkumar, is embarking on the next chapter of her life: marriage. The acclaimed actress got engaged to her dream partner, Nicholai Sachdev, in March 2024. Now, the couple is ready to begin their journey together, with their wedding set for July 2, 2024. Recently, intimate glimpses from their Mehendi ceremony have surfaced, adding to the excitement."
"Rayane Mithun, daughter of Radhikaa Sarathkumar, shared a series of photos on her Instagram handle, showcasing the soon-to-be-married couple during their mehendi ceremony. Varalaxmi looked stunning in a light-green crepe lehenga set, complemented by a statement choker, a maang teeka, and her engagement ring. Her soft makeup and middle-parted open hair added a touch of elegance. Nicholai looked dapper in a deep green kurta, white pyjama, and a beige-toned doshala, with a statement neckpiece completing his look."
"In another photo, Sarathkumar and his wife, Radikaa, posed together, radiating pride and joy. The proud father of the bride-to-be was seen applying mehendi on his hand, clearly delighted by the occasion. A video captured Sarathkumar dancing with joy, celebrating his daughter’s upcoming new phase of life."
"Back in March 2024, Varalaxmi and Nicholai exchanged rings in a traditional ceremony, marking a significant step in their relationship. Varalaxmi looked exquisite in a white Kasavu saree paired with a red blouse adorned with silver work. She completed her look with a statement neckpiece and matching earrings. Nicholai complemented her in a white kurta and Kasavu dhoti. The couple looked deeply in love as they took this meaningful step together."
"Nicholai Sachdev, previously married to Kavitha and father to a 15-year-old daughter, faced online criticism when details of his past surfaced. Varalaxmi, in an interview, defended her fiancé, stating that Nicholai is handsome in her eyes and dismissing negativity about their relationship. She highlighted that being married twice is not an issue, noting her father’s similar marital history. Varalaxmi also shared that she has a cordial relationship with Nicholai’s first wife and praised her amazing personality."
"Varalaxmi revealed that she met Nicholai 14 years ago, but their love story blossomed much later. Their journey has been one of patience and growth, culminating in their upcoming wedding. With their wedding day here, fans eagerly await more glimpses of Varalaxmi and Nicholai’s celebration. The couple’s love story, marked by elegance, resilience, and joy, continues to inspire and captivate."

"While Indians rejoice over the Men in Blue's T20 World Cup victory, there's a segment of netizens preoccupied with trolling Natasa Stankovic. The actress, yet to acknowledge Team India's win on social media, has sparked speculation among netizens about the reasons for her silence. Notably, she posted a dance video with a cryptic note shortly after the T20 World Cup win, but fans observed she didn't share any posts celebrating Hardik's victory.

A spectacular show, though first half is dragging but second half compensated it completely.<br/><br/>Casting.<br/>After the disastrous Adi Purush, Prabhas back with bang. <br/>Amithab no words to express his towering screen presence, mind blowing.<br/>Deepika will never regret donning the role of Maa<br/>Shobhna, Samuthrakani, Sawsata all have done terrific job. Anil George, Lala of Mirzapur and Anna Ben surprises.<br/>Kamal has limited screen time but he never disappoints, ferociously covered his part.<br/>And there are many characters, casting directors has put everything and pulled it off stunningly.<br/><br/>Bonus<br/>Glimpses of Mahabharata, wow, goose bumps when Karna takes Arjun and assures Ashwatma that his friends can defend him.<br/>I am 101% sure that if any industry that can bring out the Mahabharata on grand scale and without compromising our culture and tradition is Telugu Industry. I hope Rajamouli Garu and Nag Ashwin Garu should collaborate to bring this epic saga to screen.<br/><br/>Many more, but don’t want to spill out many things here, haan, don’t wait Kal ke Liye, watch this movie today!!!"

"Onitsuka is a made-in-Japan brand that started in 1977 and has redefined its luxury over the years. Every detail of their shoe collection is made from meticulous engineering for both function and form. They actively combine timeless designs with sincere traditional craftsmanship, coming with comfortable technology, and Japanese accuracy. However, this high-end shoe brand known for its distinctive designs is now available at every local store at cheap prices and quality tones. Let’s see how one can identify the fake Onitsuka Tiger shoes in the market."
"The unique logo of the brand is instantly recognizable. If you wish to check the authenticity of the shoes, then take a look at the typography and colour scheme and run it thoroughly with the original logo which has a fine line finish with a crisp, clear, uniform, and well-defined end that is hard to match."
(Image Credits: Pinterest)
"Authentic or original Onitsuka Tiger shoes are made from high-quality materials giving off a breath of fine craftsmanship and durability. One should ensure that the materials used in making these shoes stand up to the standards of Onitsuka Tiger. If you’re feeling any rough patches or fragile spots while wearing the shoes, then understand that the shoes are fake, as the brand is known for its high-end quality."
(Image Credits: Pinterest)
"The real Onitsuka Tiger kicks won’t have a loose thread end ever, as it always comes with fine and tight stitching. Therefore, before purchasing check the neat and precise stitching across the whole shoe, which should be in a proper uniform size with a distance apart and neat finishing which is not unraveling from anywhere."
(Image Credits: Pinterest)
"The original Onitsuka Tiger shoes come with high-quality packaging which precisely conveys the conciseness and value of the brand. Take a keen look at the packaging of the box, you should be able to read the name of the product, logo, and any other additional information about the sneakers printed all together in a detailed and neat format. You will also sense the high-end quality and durability of the brand."
(Image Credits: Pinterest)
"If the price appears to be too good to be true, then genuinely it is. Always keep in mind that the price of the product is much lower than the MSRP. If it is then it may be a knockoff. As Onitsuka Tiger is a premium brand, the price tag will reflect the time taken to create the product, and the money required to produce each pair of sneakers will also be mentioned with the specific code of the shoes delivered."

"The UPSC Civil Services Examination 2024 aims to fill a total of 1,056 vacancies across various central government services and departments. This includes prestigious positions in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), and Indian Foreign Service (IFS). Among these, 40 vacancies are specifically reserved for candidates from the Persons with Benchmark Disability (PWBD) category, ensuring an inclusive approach in the recruitment process."
UPSC Pre Result 2024: Detailed Application Form-I (DAF-I) submission to begin shortly
"In its UPSC CSE Prelims notice, the Commission stated, ""All of these candidates (who have qualified) must reapply using the Detailed Application Form-I (DAF-I) for the Civil Services (Main) Examination, 2024. The Commission's website will be updated in due course with the dates and important instructions for filling out the DAF-I and submitting it."""
UPSC Pre Result 2024: Prelims Attempt Counts Towards Total Attempts
"Any participation in the Preliminary Examination for the Civil Services counts as one attempt towards the total number of permissible attempts for the Civil Services Examination. This rule applies to all candidates appearing for the Prelims, regardless of whether they qualify for the Main Examination."
UPSC Pre Result 2024: Attempts Allowed Based on Category Eligibility
"Candidates eligible for the Civil Services Examination (CSE) are typically allowed six attempts to clear the exam.

"In exceptional cases, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) may consider candidates who lack the typical qualifications for the Civil Services Examination.

"This anti-ageing Korean rice gel hydrates the skin, reduces fine lines, and promotes a youthful glow."
iStock
"1 cup rice (preferably organic), 2 cups water, 1 tablespoon aloe vera gel, 1 teaspoon glycerin, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil, 1 teaspoon rose water, 2-3 drops of essential oil (optional)."
iStock
Begin by thoroughly rinsing 1 cup of rice under cold water to remove any dirt and impurities. This step ensures that your rice gel is clean and free of any unwanted particles.
iStock
Place the rinsed rice in a bowl and cover it with 2 cups of water. Let it soak for about 30 minutes. This helps to soften the rice and release its beneficial nutrients.
iStock
"Transfer the soaked rice and water to a pot and bring it to a boil. Once it reaches a boiling point, reduce the heat and let it simmer until the rice is fully cooked and soft, typically around 15-20 minutes."
iStock
"Allow the cooked rice to cool slightly. Then, place the rice and the leftover water into a blender. Blend until you achieve a smooth, creamy consistency. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more water to help it blend more easily."
iStock
"Use a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth to strain the rice mixture into a bowl. This step helps to remove any remaining rice particles, leaving you with a smooth rice gel."
iStock
"Mix in 1 tablespoon of aloe vera gel and 1 teaspoon of glycerin into the strained rice gel. Aloe vera is known for its soothing and hydrating properties, while glycerin helps to lock in moisture."
iStock
"Add 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 teaspoon of vitamin E oil to the mixture. Honey is a natural humectant and antioxidant, which helps to keep the skin moisturized and youthful. Vitamin E oil promotes skin healing and provides additional anti-aging benefits."
iStock
Stir in 1 teaspoon of rose water and 2-3 drops of your favorite essential oil (optional) for fragrance and added skin benefits. Rose water helps to balance the skin's pH and has anti-inflammatory properties. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.
iStock
"Store the anti-aging Korean rice gel in a clean, airtight container and keep it refrigerated. Apply a small amount to your face and neck, gently massaging it into your skin in upward circular motions. Use it daily as part of your skincare routine to enjoy its nourishing and anti-aging benefits."

"When Kim Go Eun graces our screens, resistance is futile - we're hooked! Many of us first adored her as the beloved Goblin's wife, and soon, we witnessed her fiercer side in new roles. And guess what? Today's her birthday; she's turning 33! So, in honor of this shining star’s special day, here's your cue to update that watchlist with her must-see titles. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to her charm, these are the shows you won't want to miss. So, cancel your plans (or maybe just postpone them a bit), and get ready to enjoy the Kim Go Eun marathon you didn’t know you needed!"
"Kim Shin (Gong Yoo), once an indomitable general in Goryeo's military, met a tragic end and gained immortality. Weary after centuries of loneliness amid mortal lives, he seeks his destined bride who can release him from his eternal curse. Enter Ji Eun Tak (Kim Go Eun), a spirited high school student despite her rough past, who has the ability to see ghosts. She boldly declares herself as the Goblin's bride, tasked with ending his immortal existence. Yet, what begins as a seemingly straightforward mission evolves into a complex journey of love and destiny as they find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other."
"In the gripping Korean thriller 'Exhuma', four strangers become entangled in a sinister secret. Shaman Hwa-rim (Kim Go-eun) and her protégé Bong-gil (Lee Do-hyun) unite to confront a curse haunting a wealthy family. In the journey, they relocate the family's tomb, where they unravel eerie revelations, unleashing uncontrollable forces. The film, which explored mysterious complexities of human behavior, was one of the highest grossing South Korean movies of 2024."
"Hong Seol (Kim Go Eun), a diligent over-achiever returning to college after a year-long hiatus due to her family's financial struggles, unwittingly crosses paths with Yoo Jung (Park Hae Jin), a senior known for his athleticism, good looks, top grades, and seemingly benevolent personality, yet harboring a mysterious dark side. Soon, Hong Seol's life spirals downward, convinced that Yoo Jung is behind her misfortunes. But just as she settles into this belief, Yoo Jung's behavior takes an unexpected turn: he begins to display a surprising friendliness towards her, leaving Hong Seol puzzled and questioning his motives anew."
"Lee Gon (Lee Min Ho), hailed as the exemplary third Korean emperor, conceals a deep scar beneath his facade of perfection. Witnessing his father's murder during a coup at the age of eight left an indelible mark on him. Now, eschewing his royal responsibilities, Lee Gon finds peace in attending university conferences outside the palace walls. It's during one such excursion that he stumbles into a parallel universe, where he crosses paths with Jeong Tae Eul (Kim Go Eun), a dedicated inspector. Together, they forge an unlikely alliance to combat criminals and unravel the mysteries binding their two worlds."
"In a world where human existence is driven by a complex network of cells, Kim Yoo Mi (Kim Go Eun) appears as any other single working woman - unassuming, ordinary. Yet beneath this facade lies a remarkable tale. Recently scarred by a painful breakup, Yoo Mi's love cells languish in a deep slumber, while the rest of her being perseveres through mundane routines. Enter Goo Woong (Ahn Bo Hyun), a game developer with emotional barriers, whose chance encounter with Yoo Mi sparks an unexpected revival in both their love cells. As their hesitant romance blossoms, fueled by the fervor of their awakened cells, the duo finds themselves drawn closer together. And guess what? It comes with two seasons!"
"In a tale of three sisters bound by a deep bond forged in poverty, their lives take a rough turn when they become entangled in a high-stakes conflict with the nation's wealthiest family. Oh In Joo (Kim Go Eun), the eldest, yearns to shield her family from financial hardship. Her dream of escaping destitution is shattered when a life-altering incident disrupts her world. Meanwhile, Oh In Kyung (Nam Ji Hyun), the middle sister and a principled news reporter, confronts a resurfaced mystery from her past investigations, determined to uncover the truth despite the powerful forces at play. The youngest, Oh In Hye (Park Ji Hu), is cherished by her dedicated sisters who sacrificed for her education. Gifted with artistic talent yet constrained by their financial struggles, she enters an elite art school, poised to defy expectations and carve her own path."

As we bring this interesting Numerology Predictions every month for you all so that you can check out your monthly predictions and let us know how did you find it..!!
"This month, influenced by the Zodiac signs Cancer (2) and Leo (1), is highly favourable for you, number 1’s. Expect more opportunities than in previous months, but be sure to choose the best ones."
"If you're considering marriage or a job change, keep your eyes wide open as this month brings more promising prospects than before. Finances are likely to improve, but the challenge will be to manage and retain your earnings."
"This is your month, governed by Cancer (2) and Leo (1), both of which are favourable for you. This period can exceed some of your aspirations. The Moon, your ruler, enhances your creativity and dreams, making not just this month but the entire year 2024 lucky for you."
"If you manage your moods, fame awaits you. Honors, awards, and recognition are within reach if you trust your intuition. Those dealing with health issues can expect recovery. Eligible singles, now is the time to mingle!"
"Remember, you've faced and overcome the toughest situations with bravery; Tough times don’t last, but tough people do! While you've set high standards for achievements, it's okay to rely on past laurels occasionally. Your hardworking and enterprising nature will see you through."
"Focus on your loved ones and be there for them when they need you the most. Not being expressive in matters of love and affection won't work forever, so it's important to improve in this area."
"This month is governed by the Cancer (2) and Leo (1) signs, both of which are linked with your ruler, Uranus (4). This planetary alignment suggests that you’ll enjoy a significant share of good fortune!"

"The second half of this month is ruled by the number 1 (Sun). Mercury (5, your number) melts with heat, and number 1 (Sun) is fiery. The key is to manage your impulses and aggression, and focus on the more meaningful tasks at hand. Next month, however, will be governed by your number, so you have much to look forward to."
"Leverage your communication and convincing skills to your advantage, but remember that being a good listener is equally important. If you persist, you will succeed, even if progress is slower than you would like. Stay patient and remain in the game."
"This month will gift you the privilege of ambition, allowing you to translate your goals into reality with your creative intellect. However, don't get discouraged if your efforts don't immediately bear fruit. Even if this month isn't perfect, remember that the entire year 2024 (a year governed by the number 6) is favourable for you."
"Your charismatic nature can charm the best, so rely on this aspect of your personality. Although you tend to be a spendthrift, don't let this indulgent month get the best of your cravings. Focus on curbing your spending to cover only your necessities."
"July is governed by numbers 2 and 1, both of which are your lucky numbers. This alignment makes for a promising period where you are likely to be more active than in the past few months."
"You will find yourself comfortably balancing between spiritual and materialistic pursuits, with a foot in each realm. Your past efforts may finally bring you the recognition and rewards you've been working toward. Financial prospects look positive as well, offering stability and growth. This month also bodes well for alliances and partnerships, both personally and professionally."
"Those looking to get hitched may find more opportunities coming their way this month. The dynamic between number 1 (Sun, ruling July) and your number, 8 (Saturn), is like that of father and son, encompassing both love and tension. Therefore, it's important not to push matters to the brink. Avoid procrastination and complete your targets in a timely manner, as time can be unpredictable."
"In matters of relationships and romance, don’t let shyness make you miss out. If you can't be loud and bold, at least try to come out of your shell. It's a beautiful world out there, waiting for you to explore and enjoy!"

"The Middle East, with its rich tapestry of history, culture, and natural beauty, offers a diverse and captivating experience for travelers. From ancient civilizations and architectural marvels to vibrant markets and exquisite cuisine, the region is a treasure trove of unique experiences. Visitors can explore vast deserts, lush oases, and stunning coastlines, each offering its own blend of adventure and tranquility. The Middle East's warm hospitality, combined with its modern amenities and deep-rooted traditions, makes it a fascinating destination for anyone seeking to immerse themselves in a blend of the old and the new.Here are five must-visit countries in the Middle East:"
"The UAE is a federation of seven emirates, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi being the most prominent. Dubai is famous for its futuristic skyline, luxury shopping, and attractions like the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Abu Dhabi offers cultural landmarks such as the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The UAE also features vast deserts perfect for safaris, beautiful beaches, and a mix of modernity and traditional Arabian culture."
"Jordan is a land of historical treasures and natural wonders. Petra, the ancient Nabatean city carved into rose-red cliffs, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-see. The country also offers the unique experience of floating in the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth, and exploring the stunning desert landscapes of Wadi Rum. Jordan's capital, Amman, provides a modern urban experience with historical sites like the Roman Theatre and the Citadel."
"Qatar is a rapidly developing country that combines modern luxury with rich cultural heritage. The capital city, Doha, features the stunning skyline of West Bay, the cultural village of Katara, and the Museum of Islamic Art. Qatar's deserts offer unique experiences like dune bashing and camel riding, while the country's beautiful beaches and resorts provide relaxation and water sports opportunities. The traditional markets, or souqs, offer a glimpse into Qatari culture and a chance to purchase local handicrafts and spices."
"Turkey straddles two continents and offers rich cultural experiences. Istanbul, the country's largest city, is renowned for its historic sites like the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, and the Blue Mosque.

"Joe Biden opting out of the race is not a possibility now after the Biden family get-together at Camp David Sunday. Biden family members were unanimous in supporting Joe Biden that he should keep fighting. Instead, the role of the advisers wh0 allowed Biden to face Trump in the debate knowing what they must have known is under scrutiny."
"New York Times which also called Biden to opt out of the contest noted the stark differences between the two Bidens. Joe Biden Two, with the help of a teleprompter, is enthusiastic and forceful, clear and concise on his position on abortion, immigration, taxes and race. ""Joe Biden Two was clear about Mr. Trump’s threat to democracy. Joe Biden One left viewers scratching their heads about the topic that the president has long said motivated his run in 2020,"" NYT observed."
"President Joe Biden's age and health were the two major issues that emerged from the 90-minute long CNN debate, the first between Biden and Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Biden appeared lost and incoherent disappointing even Democrats while video emerged of him being led by Jill Biden off the stage after the debate concluded."
"Nielsen data shows over 51 million TV viewers watched the US presidential debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, marking a 30% drop from 2020's initial debate. The new format, including microphone muting and no audience, drew mixed reviews. Despite criticism for lack of real-time fact-checking, CNN defended its approach, emphasizing question facilitation over immediate fact verification."
"Barack Obama called Joe Biden's debate disaster a bad night as he put out a supportive statement defending Joe Biden as the Democrats were tearing into the President. ""Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary forks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Barack Obama wrote. But this is posturing, in private Obama is telling people Biden can't win, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted on X."
"​Jill Biden, popularly called as Dr Biden, is under a lot of heat now as Democrat donors are blaming Dr Biden for not asking him to step aside. Billionaire Bill Ackman squarely blamed Dr Biden for dragging Joe Biden into the race for her own interest of being treated like a queen. While the Camp David family meet was supposed to be a brainstorming session on whether Biden should step aside from the race, Jill Biden gave her message loud and clear: She won't give up."
"The Biden campaign has emailed supporters advising them on how to counter criticisms of President Biden's debate performance. Despite widespread criticism, the email reaffirms Biden as the Democratic nominee and warns against calls for his replacement, arguing it would disrupt the party and benefit Trump. It stresses Biden's electoral mandate and financial preparedness for the general election."
"Historian Allan Lichtman is credited to have predicted 9 out of 10 election results correctly. Amid clamors for replacing Joe Biden as the Democrat's presidential candidate, he said it could cost the Democrat the 2024 election. He said it will be a huge mistake as those who are asking Biden to bow out of the contest are not doctors and they do not know whether Biden is capable of continuing another term or not. ""This is foolhardy nonsense,"" the American University historian said on CNN."
"White House aides have now claimed that there are two forms of Joe Biden and the debate night saw the version prone to gaffes. Biden functions fine between 10 am to 4 pm and the debate night was a disaster because it started at 9 pm, they said as Democrats are now gathering all possible excuses to justify Biden's performance and stall the clamor for Biden opting out."
"A CNN flash poll of debate watchers found 67 percent of those surveyed said Trump won the debate, compared to 33 percent who said Biden won. Vice President Harris defended Biden’s debate performance during a round of interviews on Thursday night, even as she conceded he had a “slow start.” “Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,” she said on CNN. “And what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people.”"
"During a heated presidential debate, democratic nominee Joe Biden criticized republican challenger Donald Trump for criminal convictions, including fabricating business documents and accusations of sexual assault. Trump denied allegations and countered by mentioning Biden's son, Hunter. Both candidates traded personal attacks as they clashed over legal issues and military remarks."
"US President Joe Biden, 81, and his Republican rival Donald Trump, 78, the oldest presidential candidates in America's political history, addressed concerns about their age in a Thursday faceoff ahead of the general election. Neither offered a clear answer on how they would handle the rigors of another four-year term if re-elected. Biden, who has faced scrutiny over his mental and physical acuity, briefly touched on the issue before changing the subject."
"Joe Biden's gaffes are a new normal now as the election approaches. After his wandering off at G7 which was salvaged by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, he was found lost at a fundraiser where Barack Obama came to his rescue. Now another video shows him speaking on unemployment where he by mistake said US has the highest unemployment."
"Indian-Americans are a major group who will be safeguarded from deportation fears in the new policy. Undocumented Indians are to benefit from the policy as their numbers have been steadily growing since 2011. Those who will qualify under this policy will get work authorization followed by their right to stay in the United States for up to three years. By the time, they can apply for the green card -- if married to a US citizen."
"​“I’m appalled by the scenes outside of Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles,” Biden said in post on social media site X. “Intimidating Jewish congregants is dangerous, unconscionable, antisemitic, and un-American.” Fighting between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counterprotesters erupted Sunday outside the Adas Torah synagogue in the heavily Jewish Pico-Robertson neighborhood and police were called in to break it up. In a statement, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the violence was “abhorrent” and that blocking access to a place of worship was unacceptable."
"Joe Biden's campaign has dropped the first television ad for his presidential campaign. ""This election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family,"" the ad titled 'Character Matters' said. The ad comes just 10 days before Biden and Trump are scheduled for their first face off to be hosted by CNN on June 27."
"​​Reports suggest that some Democrat politicians and operatives expressed their hopes that the 81-year-old Biden would step aside, with some even considering going to the White House to publicly voice their concerns about his candidacy."
"President Joe Biden's family used a Sunday gathering at Camp David to urge him to stay in the race and keep fighting despite his dreadful debate performance, and some members criticized how his staff prepared him for the faceoff, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Biden spent the day sequestered with first lady Jill Biden, his children and grandchildren. It was a previously scheduled trip to the presidential retreat in Maryland for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz for the upcoming Democratic National Convention."
"From the shocking news of Hina Khan's breast cancer diagnosis to the unexpected midweek eviction on Bigg Boss OTT 3, this week in television has been eventful. Karan Johar's much-awaited return with Koffee with Karan and Debina Bonnerjee bravely sharing her struggle with endometriosis pain have also made headlines, capturing attention and sparking discussions across the entertainment industry. Here’s a look at the top news from the telly industry."
"The third installment of the digital version of the reality show premiered with much fanfare on June 21. Hosted by Anil Kapoor, 15 contestants made their way inside the house along with one contestant, who will play as ‘Janta Ka Agent’. However, within just one week into the show, Bigg Boss OTT 3 saw it’s first elimination. Boxer Neeraj Goyat became the first contestant to get eliminated from the house. The housemates were given the power to decide who would be evicted. Most of them chose Shivani Kumari, who broke down in tears. Out of 14 contestants, 9 named Shivani for eviction. However, Bigg Boss announced that the audience, not the housemates, would make the final decision. Although predictions initially suggested Shivani would be voted out, Neeraj Goyat was ultimately sent home instead."
"Despite rumors of a breakup between the Bigg Boss 15 duo, Karan and Tejasswi's joyful smiles dispel them completely. The couple has been painting London red with dreamy pictures. Addressing the breakup rumors, Karan said, “This is imagination at its peak.”"
"Prince Narula and Yuvika Chaudhary joyfully announce their pregnancy, sharing the exciting news with their fans and followers as they eagerly anticipate the arrival of their first child. Prince took to social media to share pictures of a car along with a toy baby car. In a heartfelt note, he wrote, “Hi everyone, I don’t know how to express my feelings right now because we are very happy, but at the same time nervous and thankful to God and our parents. We are super excited.”"
"Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actress Hina Khan recently confirmed her diagnosis of stage three breast cancer. The 36-year-old shared the news on Instagram, reassuring her fans that she has already begun treatment and is ""doing well."" In her post, Hina expressed her determination to overcome this challenge and asked her fans to keep her in their prayers."
"Three new reality shows are all set to return. Shark Tank India, Kaun Banega Crorepati 16 and Koffee with Karan will return this year with new seasons. While registration for season 4 of Shark Tank India has begun, Kaun Banega Crorepati makers gave a peek into what’s in store for viewers in season 16 with promos featuring host Amitabh Bachchan. On the other hand, Karan Johar will return with season 9 in 2025 with a new twist."
"In an exclusive interview with ETimes TV, Vivian Dsena reflected on fatherhood, and how his journey into parenthood has enriched his perspective, both personally and professionally. He shared, “I think I have become more patient. I have, earlier, there were some, you know, negative traits in me as a human being. I got rid of them because, you know, after that, the day you see your baby in your hand, I think the whole system changes. It's like an update of software. She resembles me. Everybody says, even my mother-in-law.”"
"Debina Bonnerjee recently revealed that her endometriosis has returned. The actress and mother of two daughters shared that she was first diagnosed with the condition before Lianna’s birth, and now it has resurfaced. In her vlog, she shared, “Endometriosis is something jo aapka peechha kabhi nahi chhodta. There’s a small operation that needs to be done. Post that operation you might feel better for sometime, but it comes back. I don’t take any medicine. I prefer not to take any painkillers. When my infertility treatments began, I found out I have Endometriosis and adenomyosis. It is an abnormal growth on the wall of the uterus and outside of the uterus. The doctor told me I have grade 4 Endometriosis and adenomyosis. That pain is back. I have been experiencing this since the past 2-3 months. The pain is so much, daant me daant daal ke bardasht kar rahi hu. It is terrible.”"
"Bigg Boss OTT 3 features a diverse group of contestants, including vlogger Armaan Malik, who made a controversial entry with his two wives. However, his love story hasn't resonated well with viewers. Celebrities like Devoleena Bhattacharjee and Karan Kundrra have voiced their concerns, while Uorfi Javed has supported Armaan and his wives. Devoleena has been particularly vocal in opposing their presence saying, “Do you think this is entertainment? This is not entertainment, it's filth. Don't make the mistake of taking this lightly because it's not just a reel, it's real. I mean, I can't even understand how anyone can call this shamelessness entertainment ? I feel disgusted just hearing about it. Gross. I mean, in just 6/7 days love happened, marriage happened, and then the same thing with the wife's best friend. This is beyond my imagination.”"

"Many people habitually discard papaya seeds without realising their significant health benefits. These tiny, often overlooked seeds are packed with powerful enzymes like papain, which aid in digestion, and compounds with antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. They support liver detoxification, promote kidney health, and have shown potential in cancer prevention. Despite their slightly bitter taste, incorporating a small amount of papaya seeds into your diet can enhance overall well-being. By recognising and utilising the nutritional value of papaya seeds, we can make better use of this fruit's full health potential rather than wasting it. Here are some of the benefits of papaya seeds that can help you understand why these seeds should not be thrown away. (Images courtesy: Canva)"
"Papaya seeds contain powerful enzymes like papain, which aid in digestion by breaking down proteins and promoting a healthy gut environment. Consuming a teaspoon of these seeds daily can help alleviate digestive issues such as bloating, constipation, and indigestion. The seeds have anti-parasitic properties and have been traditionally used to expel intestinal worms and parasites."
"The liver is crucial for detoxifying our bodies. Papaya seeds are rich in vital nutrients that support liver health. Studies have shown that these seeds can help cleanse the liver and protect it from toxin-induced damage, making them a natural remedy for conditions like liver cirrhosis."
"Papaya seeds have potent antiparasitic properties. They contain an alkaloid called carpaine, which has been shown to eliminate intestinal parasites. Regular consumption of papaya seeds can help maintain a parasite-free digestive tract, promoting overall health and preventing infections."
"Inflammation is the root cause of many chronic diseases. Papaya seeds are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids, which have strong anti-inflammatory effects. Including these seeds in your diet can help reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and lower the risk of chronic illnesses like arthritis and heart disease.  Papaya seeds are high in antioxidants, which help neutralize free radicals and protect the body from oxidative stress and damage."
"Papaya seeds exhibit impressive antibacterial and antiviral properties. Research has demonstrated their effectiveness against pathogens like E. coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus. They can also combat viral infections, making them a valuable addition to your diet during cold and flu season."
"Papaya seeds support kidney health by promoting detoxification and preventing the formation of kidney stones. Their antioxidant properties help protect the kidneys from oxidative stress, ensuring they function optimally."
"Heart health is paramount, and papaya seeds can play a role in maintaining it. These seeds are known to reduce cholesterol levels and improve blood pressure regulation. The fibre content in papaya seeds also aids in lowering bad cholesterol, contributing to a healthier cardiovascular system."
"For those looking to manage their weight, papaya seeds can be a helpful ally. They contain compounds that boost metabolism and aid in fat burning. Additionally, the fibre in the seeds helps you feel fuller for longer, reducing overall calorie intake."
"Papaya seeds can contribute to glowing, healthy skin. Their antioxidant properties help combat free radicals, preventing premature aging and skin damage. Regular consumption can lead to clearer, more youthful skin by reducing acne and promoting skin cell regeneration. As per experts, antioxidants and nutrients in papaya seeds can promote healthy, youthful skin by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation."
"Emerging research suggests that papaya seeds may have anticancer properties. The seeds contain compounds like isothiocyanates, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. While more studies are needed, the potential cancer-fighting properties of papaya seeds are promising."
"Incorporating papaya seeds into your diet is easy and beneficial. Start by drying and grinding the seeds into a powder, then use a teaspoon in smoothies for a nutrient boost. Sprinkle whole or crushed seeds over salads for added crunch, or mix them into yoghurt for a healthy snack. They can also be added to salad dressings for a unique flavor. For those who enjoy a bit of spice, use ground papaya seeds as a pepper substitute in various dishes. Gradually introduce them to your diet to allow your body to adjust to their strong taste and potent properties."
"While papaya seeds offer numerous health benefits, it's important to consume them in moderation. Excessive intake can lead to digestive discomfort and potential toxicity. Pregnant women and individuals with certain medical conditions should consult a healthcare professional before adding papaya seeds to their diet."
"Incorporating papaya seeds into your daily diet can provide a multitude of health benefits, from improved digestion to enhanced liver function and even cancer prevention. These tiny seeds are a powerhouse of nutrients and medicinal properties, making them a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle. Remember to start small, enjoy them in various recipes, and consult your doctor if you have any concerns. Embrace the overlooked treasure of papaya seeds and experience their remarkable health benefits firsthand."
"Papaya seed powder is increasingly recognized for its digestive benefits. Packed with enzymes like papain and chymopapain, it aids in breaking down proteins and supports digestive health by easing constipation and bloating. The powder's potent antibacterial properties also help in balancing gut flora, promoting a healthy digestive environment. Regular consumption of papaya seed powder can alleviate digestive discomforts and enhance nutrient absorption, making it a valuable addition to maintaining digestive wellness."

"Based on the footage of North Korean leader kim jong un meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday, former CIA North Korea analyst Sue Mi Terry said Kim does not look healthy. “My first reaction looking at kim jong un was, ‘Oof, he doesn’t look too great to me,’” Terry told CNN. “There was a time when he lost a little weight and he looked better. So my initial reaction was that he didn’t look, in terms of being healthy, because his health is something that we always track anyway,"" Terry said."
"In a letter published by North Korean state media on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to establish trade and security systems with North Korea that are independent of Western influence. The letter, which appeared in the Workers' Party mouthpiece, Rodong Sinmun, came ahead of Putin's anticipated visit to the country. Putin emphasized the strong ties between Russia and North Korea, stating that over the past seven decades, the two nations have cultivated a relationship founded on ""equality, mutual respect and trust."""
"Putin and Kim Jong-un showcased their alliance in a Russian-made Aurus limousine. Despite being a symbol of Russia's domestic capability, customs records reveal significant reliance on imported parts, notably from South Korea. Between 2018 and 2023, Russia imported $34 million worth of components for Aurus, highlighting ongoing dependence on Western technology amid efforts to avoid isolation."
"A recent report by South Korea's unification ministry exposes North Korea's severe efforts to curb the influence of South Korean culture. The 2024 Report on North Korean Human Rights highlights a case where a 22-year-old man was publicly executed for consuming and distributing South Korean media, in violation of strict laws against ""reactionary ideology."" The crackdown extends to mundane practices reflecting a broader campaign initiated by North Korean leaders to shield citizens from perceived Western and South Korean influences, despite increasing cultural infiltration and dissent among the population."
"North Korea claimed a successful multiwarhead missile test, aiming to enhance defense penetration capabilities, but South Korea and US analysis declared it a failure. Experts suggest ongoing challenges in missile technology development. Recent tensions include North Korean protests against US military presence and balloon diplomacy with South Korea, while a new pact with Russia raises concerns over regional stability and missile advancements."
"North Korea test-fired what appeared to be a hypersonic missile on Wednesday, but the launch ended in a mid-air explosion, an official from Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The JCS official said the test of what appeared to be a hypersonic missile ended in failure after a journey of some 250 kilometres (155 miles)."
"Balloons filled with trash were launched towards South Korea, escalating tensions. President Yoon condemned the action and criticized a Pyongyang-Moscow agreement. Kim Yo Jong warned of counteractions, while Park Won-gon highlighted escalating border tensions. The situation remains tense as both sides engage in propaganda campaigns, with Seoul ready to respond."
"China's response to the new defence pact between Russia and North Korea remains uncertain, with concerns over power dynamics among the three authoritarian states. The pact mandates mutual defence assistance, leaving China in a challenging position."
"Tensions are escalating along the Korean border after South Korea's army fired warning shots, forcing North Korean troops to retreat. This action was taken in response to a third border intrusion by Pyongyang forces this month. According to South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff, several North Korean troops crossed the military demarcation line on Thursday. They were engaged in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border."
"South Korean activists flew balloons carrying anti-North Korean leaflets and media into North Korea, escalating tensions. This prompted North Korea to retaliate with trash-filled balloons and increased military presence at the border. Meanwhile, South Korea resumed propaganda broadcasts, aggravating the situation. Recent developments include South Korea condemning kim jong un's defence pact with Russia and considering arms aid to Ukraine, opposed by Putin."
"Russian President Putin signed agreements with Vietnamese President To Lam to strengthen ties in Asia and counter international isolation. Deals covered education, science, technology, and energy. They agreed on a nuclear center in Vietnam."
"Concerns regarding the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un have emerged following his latest public appearance alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speculation about Kim's well-being intensified after a former CIA analyst remarked, ""Oof, he doesn't look too great,"" referencing Kim's appearance during their recent meeting."
"A new mutual-defense pact between Russia and North Korea pledges aid in case of attack, echoing Cold War-era agreements. Details are vague, prompting global concern. Similar pacts exist with China and the US in Asia-Pacific, highlighting regional tensions and strategic implications amid escalating conflicts."
"Putin gifted Kim an Aurus Senat, his official presidential car, featuring a hybrid 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 engine."
"Amid international isolation due to the Ukraine conflict, Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Vietnam to bolster ties, emphasizing historical connections and cooperation in military and energy sectors. The visit underscores Russia's efforts to maintain influence in Asia despite global sanctions, while Vietnam navigates complex diplomatic dynamics with Russia and the West."

"The Maliks, Armaan, Payal and Kritika have been in the headlines for quite some time. Before entering the Bigg Boss OTT 3 house, the family was mired in serious controversies regarding their marriage, family, cases and more. Take a look at the times when Armaan Malik and his wives made headlines due to these major controversies."
"In one of their family vlogs, Payal had opened up about her pregnancy and proving that she was pregnant and gave birth to the twins. While talking about that she even shared that Armaan had gotten married earlier, she said, 'Armaan ki shaadi hui thi jab woh 17 saal ke the par unka Jama nahi aur woh alag ho gaye.' It was even revealed that he also had two children with the former wife."
"In the vlog, where Payal and Kritika opened up about Armaan's former wedding they shared that if they ever felt that things aren't working fine between them they would not shy away from seeking divorce from Armaan. Payal even mentioned, ""Pehle ki baat alag thi, humne jo tha humare paas woh de diya divorce case mein aur woh clear ho gaya. Poori zindagi iss majboori ke rishtey mein koi nah rehta hai."""
"It was reported that Armaan had already been married before marrying Payal and Kritika. He supposedly has two children with his first wife, Sumitra, who is also from Haryana. Armaan had revealed that initially, he had married Payal in the temple and not legalised his wedding till she pressurised him to go for a court marriage and certify it."
"Shortly after marrying Kritika Basera, Armaan was accused of assaulting their 16-year-old domestic assistant. As a result of this police case, he attempted suicide. In a viral video, he accused his wife Payal's relatives of filing a false complaint against him. He requested that the lawsuit be dropped or he would commit himself. Although the exact details are unknown, several web reports indicate that he was detained in the r*pe case."
"Armaan made headlines in 2019 after he threatened to commit suicide from a six-story building in West Delhi's Hari Nagar neighbourhood. The alleged incident occurred shortly after he had a heated dispute with his second wife, Kritika Basera while checking into a hotel in the capital. Payal also arrived at the occasion, amidst the tremendous turmoil and family drama that had ensued. Armaan Malik climbed the hotel's terrace, threatening suicide. Police had to intervene, and the rescue mission lasted over 20 hours."
"Armaan's sister Sapna had made shocking allegations against him and his wives. In a vlog, she mentioned that Armaan, his wife Payal, and Kritika have demanded money from her since she began making money from her vlogs. She even alleged that Payal treated her unfairly and that the suits she recently received as a present were of poor quality. Sapna further said that she had severed all relations with Armaan and his family and would never see them again in her life. She said ""Meri kamai nahi lungi main? Pichle mahine maine koi kamayi nahi ki Youtube se? Jo mera naata hai na, kuch bhi bolu, aaj mera naata toot chuka hai sbse. Jo mere saath kar rahe bol bol ke, meri beti ko bol rahe mujhe bol rahe, aaj main bta deti hu ki main kabhi bhi apne mayke nahi jaungi""."

"Korean culture has garnered global admiration for its focus on health, well-being, and holistic living. From their meticulous skincare routines to their balanced diets, Koreans have cultivated habits that promote long-term health and happiness. Here are 10 healthy Korean habits that Indians should consider incorporating into their daily lives."
Canva
"Fermented foods like kimchi and yogurt are staples in the Korean diet. These foods are rich in probiotics, which promote a healthy gut microbiome. Indians can benefit from adding more fermented foods such as homemade yogurt, pickles, and traditional fermented drinks to their diets."
Canva
"Barley tea (bori cha) is a popular beverage in Korea, known for its hydrating and digestive benefits. Replacing sugary drinks with barley tea can help Indians stay hydrated, improve digestion, and enjoy a refreshing, caffeine-free alternative."
Canva
"Koreans place a strong emphasis on regular exercise, including walking, hiking, and gym workouts. Indians can adopt this habit by incorporating more physical activities into their daily routines, such as morning walks, yoga sessions, or weekend hikes, to maintain fitness and reduce stress."
Canva
"Korean cuisine emphasizes fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and fermented foods like kimchi. Incorporating more vegetables and fermented foods into the Indian diet can improve gut health, boost immunity, and provide essential nutrients for overall well-being."
Canva
"Koreans practice mindful eating, paying attention to portion sizes and savoring each bite. Indians can benefit from this habit by slowing down during meals, focusing on the flavors and textures of their food, and avoiding overeating, which can lead to better digestion and weight management."
Canva
"Sharing meals with family and friends is a cherished tradition in Korea. Indians can strengthen family bonds and enhance their social well-being by prioritizing regular family meals, encouraging open communication, and fostering a sense of togetherness."
Canva
"Koreans never skip breakfast and often enjoy nutritious, balanced morning meals. Indians can improve their energy levels and overall health by incorporating a healthy breakfast into their daily routine, including whole grains, fruits, and proteins."
Canva
"Koreans consume various herbal teas, such as ginseng tea and green tea, for their health benefits. Indians can explore and adopt similar herbal teas known for their antioxidant properties, digestive benefits, and calming effects."
Canva
"Koreans are renowned for their elaborate skincare routines, which typically include multiple steps such as double cleansing, toning, moisturizing, and sun protection. Adopting a similar regimen can help Indians combat skin issues caused by pollution and harsh weather, ensuring a radiant and healthy complexion."
Canva
"Koreans deeply respect their elders and prioritize mental well-being through practices like meditation and mindfulness. Indians can enhance their mental health by practicing gratitude, respecting family traditions, and incorporating mindfulness techniques into their daily lives."

                                         Created : Jul 2, 2024, 00:00 IST"
"In an age where global tourism has skyrocketed, there remain a few hidden gems that receive a surprisingly low number of visitors each year. These are the least-visited countries in the world, but are no less as compared to their counterparts in offering unique experiences and boasting of untouched landscapes. These places also make for ideal destinations for travellers seeking tranquillity and adventure away from the crowded tourist trails. If you are also keen for such unique experiences, here are some of the world's least-visited countries."
"Tuvalu, a tiny island nation in the Pacific Ocean, tops the list as the least-visited country in the world. With only 3,700 tourists per year, this remote paradise offers pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and a slow-paced way of life. Its isolation is both a blessing and a curse; while it deters mass tourism, it also preserves the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the islands. Visitors can enjoy traditional Polynesian hospitality, explore coral reefs teeming with marine life, and witness the impact of climate change on this vulnerable nation."
"The Marshall Islands, another Pacific Ocean treasure, sees around 6,100 tourists annually. Known for its stunning atolls and vibrant marine biodiversity, it is a haven for divers and snorkelers. The remnants of World War II, including sunken ships and aircraft, add a historical dimension to underwater explorations. Despite its beauty, the Marshall Islands' remote location and limited infrastructure contribute to its low tourist numbers."
"Niue, a small island country in the South Pacific, attracts about 10,200 visitors each year. This self-governing territory of New Zealand boasts rugged limestone cliffs, extensive cave systems, and crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkelling and diving. Niue’s small population and lack of commercialisation make it a perfect retreat for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of more frequented destinations. The island’s commitment to eco-tourism ensures that its natural beauty remains unspoiled."
"Kiribati, comprising 33 atolls and reef islands, welcomes around 12,000 tourists annually. This Central Pacific nation offers unique cultural experiences and breathtaking seascapes. The Gilbert Islands, Phoenix Islands, and Line Islands each have their own distinct attractions, from traditional village life to world-class fishing and bird watching. Kiribati’s low tourist numbers are due in part to its remote location and limited air connections, but for intrepid travellers, it offers an authentic and rewarding experience."
"The Federated States of Micronesia, with about 18,000 annual visitors, is an archipelago of over 600 islands spread across the western Pacific Ocean. Known for its extraordinary diving sites, such as the famous Blue Hole and the Japanese shipwrecks in Chuuk Lagoon, Micronesia is a paradise for underwater enthusiasts. The islands’ diverse cultures, lush landscapes, and historical sites offer a rich and varied travel experience. Despite its appeal, Micronesia remains off the beaten path due to its geographical isolation."
"Montserrat, a small Caribbean island, attracts roughly 19,300 tourists per year. This British Overseas Territory is known for its active volcano, Soufrière Hills, which dramatically reshaped the island in the 1990s. The volcanic activity has created a unique landscape, with lush greenery contrasting starkly with the ash-covered southern part of the island. Montserrat offers hiking, diving, and a chance to explore the ‘Pompeii of the Caribbean,’ the buried city of Plymouth. The island’s low tourist numbers can be attributed to its recovery from volcanic eruptions and limited accessibility."
"The Solomon Islands, with around 29,000 visitors annually, is a tropical paradise in the South Pacific. Comprising nearly 1,000 islands, it boasts stunning coral reefs, WWII relics, and vibrant indigenous cultures. The islands’ remote location and underdeveloped tourism infrastructure contribute to its low visitation numbers, but those who do make the journey are rewarded with unspoiled natural beauty and rich cultural experiences. The Solomon Islands are ideal for eco-tourists and history buffs alike."

"Russian literature is simply elite! It is sophisticated, deep, thought-provoking, and at times ‘Oh-so-scandalous’. But, Russian literature has not reached many people as yet in biblio-circuits. Here we mention 8 amazing books to read when starting out."
Canva-AI
"This novel is about the lives of 3 brothers and their father - Fyodor Pavlovich, and three sons - Alyosha, Ivan, and Dmitri. The book talks about human nature and the eternal struggle between good and evil."
Penguin-Classics
"Set against the Napoleonic Wars, this epic novel follows the lives of aristocratic families. It is an extremely heavy book and a complicated read that blends in itself personal stories, historical events, and a view of Russian society."
Penguin-Classics
"‘Dead Souls’ follows the life of Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov, as he travels through the Russian countryside, buying the rights to deceased serfs from landowners. His scheme is to use these ""dead souls"" to acquire a large estate and make himself a ‘Gentleman’."
Penguin-Classics
"‘Lolita’, a novel considered inappropriate and controversial even today, is about the life of Humbert, a literature professor who becomes obsessed with a twelve-year-old girl named Dolores."
Penguin-Classics
‘Uncle Vanya’ is famous as a play written by Chekhov who was an exemplary playwright. The story is about the frustrations and disappointments of the characters living on a rural estate. The arrival of Serebryakov and his young wife Yelena changes some lives.
Penguin-Classics
"‘The Dream Life of Sukhanov’ is about Anatoly Sukhanov, an art critic who once dreamed of being a surrealist painter. But, now that he is old and the regime is about to change, his past comes back to him, and he re-thinks about several of his decisions and dreams."
Penguin-Classics
"‘A Hero of Our Time’ is a series of interconnected stories about Pechorin, a Byronic hero whose actions reveal his cynical, manipulative nature."
Penguin-Classics
"‘Fathers and Sons’ is about the life of Arkady, Bazarov, and the Kirsanov family. The novel shows the clash between the older generation of traditionalists and the younger generation of nihilists in 19th-century Russia."
Penguin-Classics

"Throughout history, many cities have been lost to time, only to be rediscovered centuries later. These ancient cities, once thriving centers of civilization, offer a glimpse into the past and reveal the ingenuity and culture of their inhabitants. The rediscovery of these cities has often been the result of dedicated archaeological efforts, sometimes sparked by legends and historical texts. Here are seven such cities that have been brought back to light.Image: Canva"
"Pompeii was buried under volcanic ash and pumice after the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The city remained hidden until its rediscovery in 1748 by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre. Excavations revealed well-preserved buildings, artifacts, and even casts of the victims, providing invaluable insights into Roman life. The sudden burial preserved Pompeii in a state of suspended animation, making it one of the most significant archaeological sites in the world.Image: Canva"
"Machu Picchu, the Incan citadel located high in the Andes Mountains, was brought to international attention by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. Although known to local indigenous people, it had been forgotten by the outside world. The site, believed to have been built in the 15th century, showcases the architectural prowess of the Incas with its terraced fields, temples, and intricate stone constructions. Machu Picchu is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction.Image: Canva"
"The ancient city of Troy, immortalized in Homer’s epic poems, was long thought to be a myth. Its rediscovery in the 1870s by German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann confirmed its existence. Located in modern-day Turkey, the site revealed multiple layers of settlements dating back to the Bronze Age. Schliemann’s excavations uncovered fortifications, houses, and artifacts, including what he claimed to be “Priam’s Treasure.” Troy’s rediscovery has provided a wealth of information about ancient civilizations in the region.Image: Canva"
"Angkor, the capital of the Khmer Empire, was rediscovered in the 19th century by French explorer Henri Mouhot. The city, which flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries, is home to the famous Angkor Wat temple complex. Angkor’s rediscovery revealed a vast urban landscape with sophisticated water management systems, temples, and palaces. The site is evidence of the architectural and engineering skills of the Khmer people and remains a significant cultural and historical landmark.Image: Canva"
"Petra, also known as the “Rose City,” was rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812. This ancient Nabatean city, carved into the red sandstone cliffs, was a major trading hub in the 4th century BC. Petra’s rediscovery unveiled its stunning rock-cut architecture, including the iconic Treasury and Monastery. The city’s strategic location and advanced water management systems highlight the ingenuity of the Nabateans. Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination.Image: Canva"
"Mohenjo-Daro, one of the principal cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, was rediscovered in the 1920s by Indian archaeologist R. D. Banerji. The city, dating back to around 2500 BCE, featured advanced urban planning with grid-like streets, drainage systems, and public baths. Excavations revealed a highly organized society with a rich cultural heritage. Mohenjo-Daro’s rediscovery has provided important insights into one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations.Image: Canva"
"The ancient city of Ebla was rediscovered in the 1960s by Italian archaeologist Paolo Matthiae. Located in modern-day Syria, Ebla was a major center of trade and culture in the 3rd millennium BCE. Excavations uncovered a vast archive of cuneiform tablets, revealing the city’s extensive diplomatic and commercial networks. The discovery of Ebla has significantly enhanced our understanding of early Semitic languages and the political landscape of the ancient Near East.Image: Canva"

Lauding the Indian cricket star, former Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad said that India would have never won the T20 World Cup final without Virat Kohli's innings, adding that no one should compare Babar Azam or any other cricketer to the former Indian captain."
"South Africa's David Miller was disappointed after losing to India in the ICC T20 World Cup final. India won by seven runs, ending their ICC trophy drought and securing their second ICC T20 World Cup title. India's effective death bowling, impressive batting from Virat Kohli and Axar Patel, and Miller's dismissal sealed the victory."

Republican Party
Democratic Party
"The 2020 election is the 59th quadrennial presidential election. Incumbent President Donald Trump will be challenged by Democratic former vice president Joe Biden for the top post. While Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate, Trump endorsed the name of incumbent vice president Mike Pence.

In the last election, held in 2016, Trump defeated Democrat and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.This was the fifth presidential election in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote.

While Hillary won 2.87 million more votes than Trump did, the latter received the majority in the Electoral College. Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton 227.

The run-up to the 2016 elections was marred by allegations of Russian interference in the elections to ""undermine public faith in the US democratic process and to denigrate presidential candidate Hillary Clinton"". In January 2017, the US government's intelligence agencies found the involvement of the Russian government in the 2016 polls.

In this election, Trump administration's response to Coronavirus, protest against killings of African American, the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and the future of Affordable Care Act are some of the issues hogging the limelight in this election.

While Trump secured Republican nomination without much opposition, Biden was selected as the Democratic nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. The Democratic primaries were termed as one of the most-competitive seen in the recent US election history. It saw one of the largest pool of presidential candidates for any political party.

If elected, Biden would become the oldest person to serve as president at 78 years old. This is the first presidential election in US history where both the presidential candidates are over 70. Seventy-four-year-old Trump is the oldest first-term US president.

The winner of the 2020 US presidential election will take oath as the 46th US president on January 20, 2021. The coronavirus pandemic meant that a record 90 million people — about 65% of the total turnout in 2016 — have voted three-day before the scheduled date of November 3.

A lot of people are also voting early to avoid long queues and crowds at a time when coronavirus has claimed the lives of 230k people in the country."

This makes it extremely important to take preventive measures during monsoon season to prevent the risk of dengue. Here are a few tips:
Getty Images
"Dengue symptoms include sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. In severe cases, dengue can lead to hemorrhagic fever, bleeding, abdominal pain, vomiting, and difficulty breathing."
Getty Images
"Remove stagnant water sources such as containers, flower pots, and old tires where mosquitoes breed. Regularly empty and clean water storage containers to prevent larvae from developing."
Getty Images
"Apply mosquito repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin when outdoors, especially during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active."
Getty Images
"Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and closed shoes to minimize exposed skin and reduce the risk of mosquito bites, particularly in areas with high mosquito activity."
Getty Images
Use screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from entering indoor spaces. Repair any holes or tears in screens to ensure they are effective barriers.
Getty Images
"Sleep under mosquito nets, especially if you live in or are traveling to areas with a high prevalence of dengue. Ensure the nets are properly tucked in and do not have any holes."
Getty Images
"Maintain a clean and well-maintained environment both indoors and outdoors. Trim tall grass and bushes, and dispose of garbage properly to reduce potential mosquito resting and breeding sites."
Getty Images
Participate in community-based mosquito control programs. Collaborate with neighbors to collectively eliminate breeding sites and implement preventive measures in shared spaces.
Getty Images
"Stay informed about dengue outbreaks and avoid traveling to regions experiencing high transmission rates of the virus. If travel is unavoidable, take extra precautions to prevent mosquito bites."
Getty Images
"Consult healthcare professionals for guidance on dengue prevention, particularly if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant. They can provide personalized advice and recommend appropriate preventive measures."

"Mughlai cuisine is rich in flavours and aromas, which became part of the Indian food scenario as early as the 15th century AD. From vegetarian to non-vegetarian dishes, they brought in a lot of flavours that revolve around the use of whole spices. Here’s a list of 10 dishes that are no less than the gifts of the Mughals to India. (Images Courtesy: istock)"
"For the uninitiated, Qorma originated in Persia, and was later adopted by Rajput chefs in Akbar's kitchen; later, it was termed Korma, after the Rajput tribe Kurma. This popular recipe is made with chicken pieces cooked in rich and creamy gravy."
Kebabs travelled from Turkey to India towards the end of the 14th century and are a delectable treat made with boneless chicken skewered and cooked over an open flame.
"Another popular dish from Mughlai cuisine is Mutton Seekh Kebab, made with minced mutton."
"It's a bread recipe made with refined flour, stuffed with onions, herbs, meat, and spices."
It has also become a part of Mughlai cuisine. It is made with boiled eggs and minced meat and is best served with rice.
"It is said that this kebab was created for a Lucknow Nawab, who could not chew properly, and that is when this melt-in-the-mouth kebab was made. It is best paired with flaky tandoori roti, naan, or lachha paratha."
"It's a rice, meat, and spice dish that became popular in the 16th century and is now available in many variations."
This is a mutton meat preparation that was introduced to India by the Mughals and has now become a staple of India.
The dish was consumed by Mughal emperors after morning prayers and was traditionally made with mutton stuffed with juicy bone marrow. It is best served with naan and rice.
"It's a dessert treat made with rabdi, or thickened milk, fried bread slices, kesar, malai, and roasted nuts."

Starting the week on a productive note sets the tone for success ahead. Here are ten effective ways to make your Monday more productive:
Getty Images
"Spend a few minutes planning your Monday. Create a to-do list prioritizing tasks for the day. This helps you hit the ground running when Monday arrives, reducing stress and increasing efficiency."
Getty Images
"Begin your Monday morning with a clear focus and determination. Arrive a bit earlier than usual to settle in, review your plan, and prepare mentally for the day. Early mornings often provide a quieter, distraction-free environment conducive to productivity."
Getty Images
Identify and prioritize the most critical tasks on your to-do list. Addressing them early in the day ensures they receive your best energy and attention. Completing important tasks first also alleviates pressure later in the day.
Getty Images
"Minimize interruptions and distractions to maintain focus throughout the day. Consider silencing non-essential notifications, closing unnecessary tabs, and setting specific times to check emails and messages. Creating a distraction-free environment enhances productivity significantly."
Getty Images
"Schedule short breaks between tasks to recharge and maintain mental clarity. Breaks can include a short walk, stretching exercises, or simply stepping away from your workspace. These pauses rejuvenate your mind and prevent burnout, improving overall productivity."
Getty Images
"Keep your workspace tidy and organized to minimize time spent searching for documents or supplies. Use folders, trays, or digital tools to manage documents and tasks efficiently. An organized workspace fosters a clear mind and enhances productivity."
Getty Images
Experiment with productivity techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique (working in focused intervals with breaks) or time-blocking (allocating specific time slots for tasks). Finding a method that suits your work style enhances productivity and time management.
Getty Images
"Maintain a positive mindset and approach your tasks with enthusiasm. Celebrate small accomplishments throughout the day to stay motivated. Positive thinking boosts productivity and resilience, helping you navigate challenges effectively."
Getty Images
"Incorporate mindfulness practices into your day to reduce stress and improve focus. Practice deep breathing, meditation, or mindful walking to enhance mental clarity and productivity. Mindfulness techniques promote a calm and centered mindset."
Getty Images
"At the end of your Monday, take a few moments to reflect on your achievements and challenges. Review your progress against your weekly goals and adjust your plan if necessary. Planning ahead for the rest of the week sets you up for continued productivity and success."
Getty Images
Focus on one task at a time to maximize efficiency and accuracy. Multitasking can lead to mistakes and decreased productivity. Prioritize tasks and complete them sequentially to maintain quality and momentum.
Getty Images
Allocate specific time blocks for different tasks and activities throughout the day. Schedule focused work sessions with breaks in between to maintain productivity and prevent burnout. Time blocking helps manage your time effectively and improves task completion rates.
Getty Images
"Acknowledge and celebrate your accomplishments at the end of the day. Recognize your efforts and achievements, no matter how small. Positive reinforcement boosts morale and motivates you to continue striving for success."

"The article discusses the political tenure of Naveen Patnaik, focusing on both his intangible and tangible contributions to Odisha. It contrasts these achievements with perceived administrative shortcomings and critiques, culminating in the BJP's electoral victory which ended Patnaik's long-standing rule."
Naveen Patnaik’s legacy – Hype and reality
"As the dust of months-long election campaigning settles and the first BJP government takes over the reins in Odisha, the most important question that pops into one’s mind is about the legacy of Naveen Patnaik, the ex-Chief Minister of Odisha who rode the political scene of the state like a Colossus for about two and half decades."
"Naveen was a larger-than-life figure while he was the CM. His was a carefully built persona-not responsible for wrongs committed by his administration and party but the progenitor of every welfare measure and development initiative taken during his tenure. Now that he is no more at the helm of Odisha’s affairs and his party BJD’s overwhelming presence is a thing of the past, this is the time to dispassionately assess his contributions to Odisha."
"Let’s talk about his intangible contributions first. Even his worst enemies will admit that Naveen is gentlemanliness personified. He carried himself with dignity and never used harsh words against his adversaries. Because of the sophistication and grace that he exuded, he was popular in the national media thus saving Odias from any taunt about their CM while interacting with non-Odias, unlike the Bengalis who have to face embarrassment when non-Bengalis mock the various utterances and pronunciational gaffes of their CM Mamata Banerjee. Further, Naveen had a clean image and no corruption allegation was levelled against him personally."
"Coming to his tangible contributions to Odisha, his topmost achievement was navigating through natural disasters like cyclones which hit Odisha frequently. He knew well that it was the inept handling of the affairs post the super cyclone of 1999 by the then Congress Government that brought the alliance of BJD and BJP to power under his leadership. Odisha under his stewardship earned praise for evacuating citizens to safety during the cyclones of Phailin and Fani which hit the state in 2013 and 2019 respectively. Though poverty levels in Odisha still remain high, the state has gradually come down in the list of states having high multi-dimensional (with equally weighted three dimensions of health, education and standard of living) poverty. As per the document called National Multi-dimensional Poverty Index-A Progress Review 2023 published by Niti Ayog, in the list of states with the percentage of the total population who are multi-dimensionally poor, Odisha stood eighth."
"This is a vast improvement from the situation about 3 decades back when Odisha used to be among the top 1-2 poorest states of India.  Naveen government also promoted the national game of Hockey in a big way hosting the Men’s Hockey World Cup Tournament more than once, thus bringing Odisha to national glare. BJD Government is also credited with launching initiatives like Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY) and strengthening Mission Shakti for providing free healthcare to poorer sections of the populace and empowering women from disadvantaged backgrounds, respectively."
"But many were unimpressed by the progress achieved by Odisha under the stewardship of Naveen Patnaik considering the long period of almost a quarter century of BJD rule.  It was felt among broad sections of the citizenry that during his five continuous terms, the state could have achieved much more. For example, very few industries were set up and employment opportunities were created during Naveen’s 24-year rule. Notwithstanding the ridiculously low unemployment rate of about 0.90% in 2023 as reported by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), droves of young people leave Odisha every year to do menial jobs in various other states of India."
"The reason for the reported low unemployment figure in Odisha is said to be not too many young unemployed Odias staying in the state, having shifted to other states for work. Further, Naveen’s uninterrupted reign of 24 years brought its associated malaises of rampant corruption, goonda raj and general degradation in the area of law and order. Though the capital city of Bhubaneswar saw development, much of the interior regions of the state remained mired in poverty and under-development."
"But what actually did the BJD was the factor of perception about the governance model dominated by serving and former bureaucrats. The role of Tamil Nadu-born V. K Pandian, ex-IAS and aide of Naveen who joined the BJD a few months back became the most lethal arrow in the quiver of the main opposition BJP. Considered to be the ‘Super Chief Minister’ of Odisha by friends and foes of BJD, Pandian welded enormous power due to his exclusive access to Mr. Patnaik. With Naveen confined to his residence due to health factors, Pandian became the sole star campaigner for BJD who crisscrossed the state addressing gatherings unaccompanied by any important BJD leader."
"There was credible apprehension in the minds of a vast number of Odias that considering Pandian’s vice-like grip on the ruling party and government not to mention Naveen himself, the former would succeed Mr. Patnaik should BJD return to power. BJP exploited this chink in the armour of the ruling party and made Odia Asmita (identity) the major campaign issue. Naveen’s reluctance to learn Odia despite being the CM for so long also came in handy to BJP to add credibility to the charge that Odia identity is under threat. This poll plank of BJP set the cat among the pigeons and Naveen had to clarify that his successor would be chosen by the people of the state. But by that time, it was already late and a wave had started to build in favour of BJP which unseated Naveen after long 24 years of rule."
"Considering the not-so-encouraging showings of the BJP in other states, its performance in both Lok Sabha elections (in which it won 20 out of 21 seats in the state) and assembly elections in Odisha was the jewel in the crown of its electoral success. However, the nascent BJP government can eclipse the positive aspects of Naveen’s legacy only by the glow of sustained all-round growth of Odisha coupled with the creation of ample job opportunities."

"An IAS aspirant in New Delhi was scammed of Rs 1.2 lakh after being lured to a cafe by a woman he met on Tinder. The woman, named Versha, left under the pretext of a family emergency, leaving the victim with an exorbitant bill. Investigations revealed a gang running similar schemes across major cities."
IAS aspirant scammed of Rs 1.2L after Tinder date in New Delhi
"A civil service aspirant’s wish to find love on Tinder's popular dating app went terribly wrong after he was scammed of Rs 1.2L in the National Capital. When he swiped right on Tinder, he had no idea he was walking into a trap. Little did he know that he was walking into a sinister plot planned to scam single men looking for love on Tinder or other dating apps."
"According to Delhi police, the victim had recently been matched with a girl named Versha. The girl called him to Black Mirror Café in East Delhi’s Vikas Marg area to celebrate her so-called birthday. At the café, the woman ordered some snacks, two cakes and four shots of non-alcoholic beverage."
"The ‘date' was going well until Versha received a call and had to rush out to due a family emergency. The victim then finished the food alone and asked for the bill which left him stunned. He received a whopping Rs 1,21,917.70 bill for food that should not cost him more than Rs 1000."
"When the victim disputed the bill, he was threatened and beaten up, forced to pay. Fearing for his life, the victim paid the money online that went to the café’s owner – 32-year-old Akshay Pahwa. Coming out of the café, he went straight to the cops and filed a case."
"Shocking details later emerged during the investigation. During the investigation, Akshay who is a Class 10 fail revealed the modus operandi of their gang.                They have opened the café and use Versha, who also goes by the names of Ayesha, Noor and Afsan Parveen to lure men and then siphon off money from them."
"Later, Versha was tracked down who was at another café on a ‘date’ with a man from Mumbai she had met on Shaadi.Com. Later, Versha revealed all the details to the cops. They catch up with men on dating and matrimonial apps and lure them to date."
"Later, Versha feigns a family emergency and rushes out and her date is made to pay a huge amount in the name of the bill. Later, 15% of the money goes to Versha, 45% is divided among the table and café managers, and the remaining 40% to the owners."
"Several such schemes are in play in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad to extort money from unwitting victims, Delhi police said. Efforts are on to arrest other accused, the police added."

Speculations arise about the BJD's future as party leader Naveen Patnaik urges unity and strength amid signs of internal dissent and poor performance in the 2024 elections. The controversy surrounds VK Pandian's continued influence despite his retirement.
"On Wednesday, the BJD elected Naveen Patnaik as the leader of the opposition (LoP) and the legislature party leader. It is for the first time that Naveen Patnaik, who ruled Odisha for 24 years as the Chief Minister, is now the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Odisha Assembly."
"Following the BJD's significant loss in the 2024 General Elections, VK Pandian is still seen as a central figure despite his retirement from active politics. Political analysts suggest that internal party dynamics and overconfidence led to their defeat, with continued delays in reviewing the election results."
"Mohan Majhi, recently appointed as the Chief Minister, faces criticism alleging he was chosen to facilitate iron ore exploitation in Keonjhar, Odisha by Ambani and Adani. Critics ignore past unchecked mining abuses and instead focus on vilifying Majhi without awaiting his administrative actions."
"In a candid moment during the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected MLAs in Odisha, former CM Naveen Patnaik acknowledged his defeat to BJP's Laxman Bag from Kantabanji."
"The article discusses the political tenure of Naveen Patnaik, focusing on both his intangible and tangible contributions to Odisha. It contrasts these achievements with perceived administrative shortcomings and critiques, culminating in the BJP's electoral victory which ended Patnaik's long-standing rule."
"As per reports, all 147 MLAs are scheduled to be administered oath on June 18 and June 19. The Odisha Assembly Speaker election is scheduled for June 20."
"Newly-elected Khordha MLA Prashant Jagdev, released on interim bail, criticized BJD president Naveen Patnaik and defended bureaucrat-turned-politician VK Pandian after BJD's defeat in the 2024 elections. BJP won 78 out of 147 assembly seats. Jagdev thanked Khordha voters and attended the new government's swearing-in ceremony."
Patnaik reiterated that the 4.5 crore people of Odisha are his family and he will continue to serve them in whichever way he can.
"Some leaders and critics were of the view that it was due to the IAS officer-turned-politician, that the ruling BJD lost the trust of the people. Prior to and during the elections, Pandian was making statements on issues by calling national and local media persons."
"The article reflects on Naveen Patnaik's political tenure as he steps down, critiquing his governance and its impact on Odia culture and politics. It highlights his manipulative political strategies, possible corruption, and the perceived betrayal by his trusted aide, alongside the disillusionment with his secular claims."
"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik clarified that VK Pandian is not his successor, aiming to quell rumors and manage the damage this speculation caused to BJD's election prospects. Despite the announcement, skepticism remains among voters as BJD faces significant challenges in the ongoing elections."
"At a presser in Bhubaneswar, Aparajita Sarangi alleged that Odisha’s power corridor, the third floor and the coterie group are involved in the conspiracy behind Prashant Jagdev’s arrest."
"Going into the final phase of elections, political parties are organizing public meetings and rallies with an increased frequency."
"Post the third phase of elections in Odisha, BJP, BJD, and Congress have started claiming potential victory and government formation. BJD's Naveen Patnaik is confident despite challenges, while BJP has cited increased support and high-profile visits as success factors. Conversely, Congress has positioned itself as an alternative amidst higher polling percentages."

"The Indian cricket team is stranded in Barbados after their T20 World Cup victory due to Hurricane Beryl, which has intensified into a Category 4 storm. The hurricane is causing flight delays and airport shutdowns, with severe weather warnings in effect across the region."
"Anushka Sharma shared a heartfelt post for her husband Virat Kohli after India's T20 World Cup win against South Africa. Despite recent poor form, Kohli's crucial innings led to India's triumph. His partnership with Axar Patel and Shivam Dube was pivotal. Both Anushka and Virat expressed gratitude and love for each other following the victory."
"Rohit Sharma's triumphant moment after the ICC T20 World Cup final, where he collapsed in joy, has captured the hearts of Indian cricket fans. Sharing an emotional Instagram post, Rohit reflected on the victory. His announcement of retirement from T20Is has left fans heartbroken."
"Left-arm spin all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja announced his retirement from T20 Internationals after India's victory in the Men's T20 World Cup at Kensington Oval.

He expressed gratitude for his career and committed to continuing in ODIs and Tests."
Renowned sand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik created a 20 ft long bat and 500 balls sculpture at Puri beach to congratulate Team India and captain Rohit Sharma for winning the T20 World Cup. His students helped create a World Cup trophy and Rohit Sharma's sculpture.
India's captain Rohit Sharma described winning the 2024 T20 World Cup as the pinnacle of his career. India secured a dramatic seven-run victory over South Africa in the final. Both Rohit and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20 internationals following this win. Rohit emotionally dedicated the triumph to coach Rahul Dravid for his immense contribution to Indian cricket.
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the Indian Cricket Team for their ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 victory. He praised Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Surya Kumar Yadav, and Jaspreet Bumrah for their performances. Modi also thanked coach Rahul Dravid."
"India defeated South Africa by seven runs in a thrilling T20 World Cup final, ending their 17-year wait for a second title. The emotional victory saw captain Rohit Sharma and key players like Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya shed tears of joy, marking a significant moment in Indian cricket history."
"Celebrities from various fields, including politicians and film stars like Shashi Tharoor, Chiranjeevi, and Anupam Kher, celebrated India's incredible T20 World Cup victory against South Africa.

"India captain Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20I cricket following India's triumphant World Cup win in Barbados. His decision comes after Virat Kohli also retired from T20Is. Rohit will continue to play ODIs and Tests, ending his T20I career as the format's highest scorer with five centuries."
"Star batter Virat Kohli announced his retirement from T20 Internationals after leading India to their second T20 World Cup win. He played a crucial 59-ball 76-run innings, securing a Man of the Match award in his final T20I game."
"Team India emerged victorious in the T20 World Cup after a thrilling final against South Africa at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. India won by 7 runs."
"Virat Kohli's timely fifty propelled India to a total of 176 for seven against South Africa in the T20 World Cup final. Kohli's 76 and Axar Patel's crucial 47 helped recover from early setbacks, including the dismissals of Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, and Suryakumar Yadav."

"The BCCI has shortlisted Gautam Gambhir and W.V. Raman for the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, set to start their role from the Sri Lanka series beginning July 27. This follows India's T20 World Cup win and marks the end of Rahul Dravid's tenure."
"Cricket returns to Barabati Stadium in Cuttack with an ODI between India and England scheduled for February 9, 2025. This match is part of the BCCI's announced fixtures for Team India's 2024-25 international home season."
"CAC members will be in for a big dilemma over picking one between Gambhir and Raman. With Raman’s experience and his rather impressive interview for the head coach role, BCCI may spring a surprise."
"Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir is poised to become the next head coach for the India men's cricket team, with an interview scheduled in Mumbai at BCCI headquarters. His demands, including full command of the team and separate teams for different formats, have been reportedly accepted by the BCCI."
The report stated that the former southpaw is ready to take on the challenges to coach the Men in Blue in all the three formats.
"A report published in some sections of media suggested that a 'very high-profile owner of an IPL franchise, who is very close to the BCCI top brass told that former India star's appointment as Indian cricket team coach is a 'done deal and the announcement will come soon'."
"However, it is not clear at this stage whether the BCCI has received any applications from genuine candidates who are interested in the responsibility."
"Legendary Australian cricketer and the current head coach of the Delhi Capitals Ricky Ponting has confirmed that BCCI had approached him for the job. However, it is highly unlikely that he would apply for the job."
BCCI is not ready to give up on Fleming yet. Dhoni is likely to be their last throw of the dice.
"Gautam Gambhir is reportedly being considered by the BCCI for India's next senior men's head coach, succeeding Rahul Dravid after his term ends in 2024. Gambhir, a former cricketer and current IPL mentor, lacks coaching experience but has shown leadership in past roles."
Let’s have a look at some of the candidates who could bag the challenging job as the head coach of the Indian team…
"Some of the IPL franchise head coaches, who have been a part of the T20 league for quite some time, are likely to be in fray."
The former great will potentially pave the way for a fresh perspective and a new era in Indian cricket.
"The BCCI has unveiled India’s squad for the ICC T20 Men's World Cup 2024, set to occur in the West Indies and the USA starting June 1. The team includes notable players like Rohit Sharma (Captain) and Virat Kohli, with reserves including Shubman Gill."
"According to Agarkar, the fitness blueprint designed by Virat Kohli has had a ripple effect on the whole Indian cricketing ecosystem."

"Mohan Majhi's new government started well with initial actions like opening Lok Seva Bhavan to journalists and Lord Jagannath temple to the public. However, issues arose with delayed portfolio allocations and excessive bureaucratic control, suggesting need for democratic reforms and better leadership distribution."
Odisha CM Mohan Majhi
"The first 24 hours after the swearing in went just fine. The first cabinet meeting – without portfolios allocated to the newly inducted ministers – took place within a couple of hours and approved the four major poll promises of the party. The gates of the Lok Seva Bhavan were opened for journalists - after over four years – the same evening. And all four gates of the Lord Jagannath temple in Puri were thrown open to the public the next morning – again after four years. Mohan Majhi, the new Chief Minister, did the rounds of the statues of Odia icons and paid floral tributes to them, in the company of his two deputies - Kanak Vardhan Singhdeo and Pravati Parida - the morning after. The optics were unexceptionable."
"But having begun well, the new BJP government has faltered at the very first hurdle. First, the allocation of portfolios was delayed by three full days. And when it finally came, the most important portfolio – finance – was conspicuously missing in the list of departments allocated to ministers, requiring the release of a revised list by Raj Bhavan within an hour of the first. This was an eminently avoidable embarrassment, presumably caused by lack of homework and attention to detail."
"But the bigger embarrassment for the government was the delay of three days in the allocation of portfolios, which has traditionally been done within a few hours of the swearing in. The inordinate delay deepened the impression in the minds of the people that the Mohan Majhi government will have no freedom to act on its own and will be ‘remote controlled’ by the ruling party’s central leadership. Some of the ministers unwittingly buttressed this impression by expressing gratitude to the party’s central leaders, apart from the CM, for giving them the responsibility of the department. Dispelling this impression that every major decision of the Majhi government will be taken – or vetted – in Delhi, therefore, should be the most immediate task for the new dispensation."
"The second biggest challenge for the new government will be reining in the bureaucrats, who had been allowed – and even encouraged – to exceed their brief during the long running previous regime. The system that Naveen Patnaik had put in place, where bureaucrats call all the shots while elected representatives, including ministers, look on helplessly is not only untenable, but is completely against the spirit of democratic governance. A complete overhaul of the skewed bureaucrat-legislator(minister) equation thus should be one of the first tasks on the Majhi government’s agenda. But with experience of running a department at a premium in the new government (half the ministers are first time MLAs), this is easier said than done."
"There is no real pattern that emerges from the distribution of portfolios on Saturday evening, suggesting that not much thought has gone into it. The CM has kept far too many departments, including the key ones of Home and Finance – with himself. With so many departments to look after, he would hardly get time to do what he needs to do most: give leadership to his team and to constantly monitor and review its performance. Some of the departments could perhaps have been allocated to senior leader Suresh Pujari, whose cupboard looks rather barren with only Revenue and Disaster Management. While he is a first time MLA, he has been in politics long enough to do justice to his ministerial duties. He was, after all, the top contender for the CM’s post before Mohan Majhi emerged out of the blue. It is, of course, possible that Majhi would shed some of the departments that he currently holds when the ministry is expanded and new ministers are inducted. Here again, the government could have avoided unnecessary speculation and intrigue by inducting all 22 ministers in one go."
"Every new government deserves – and usually gets – a ‘honeymoon period’ of a few months before judgments are passed on its performance. But thanks to a vicious, no-holds-barred campaign that has uprooted a 24-year old tree with deep roots in the soil, the Majhi government is unlikely to get such courtesy. In fact, the barbs against the new government had started flying thick and fast even before it had been sworn in – and even before Majhi had been named the Chief Minister. It was, of course, only to be expected for two reasons. First, the Naveen Patnaik government might have gone out of power; but those who helped sustain it for so long haven’t lost any of their power. Second, a newly ‘freed’ media will subject the Majhi government to greater – and much stricter – scrutiny than it has ever dared to do during the previous regime."
The Majhi government thus has its task cut out.

"The Biju Patnaik International Airport (BPIA) in Bhubaneswar may soon be privatised.As per reports published in some sections of national media, as many as 11 airports across the country may be privately managed soon. The reports stated that among the 11 airports, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy airports are likely be privatised. As a result, efforts will be made for the development and augmentation of these airports. The airports that are incurring losses will be given priority for privatisation. On the basis of profit and loss, a list of the airports will be made and accordingly, bidding will be done. If a company takes over an airport making profit, it also has to take responsibility of an airport incurring loss. However, the final decision regarding the elaborate bidding process will be taken in the cabinet meeting. Notably, BPIA is a profit-making airport and the air traffic is gradually increasing here. Adani Group is reportedly leading the race to take over BPIA. As per sources, the infrastructure of BPIA will be developed after privatisation and it will be better managed. Though the price of air travel will increase a little bit, the passengers will get better facilities."

"Ans:- Despite being rich in natural resources like it has largest deposits of many minerals, it is blessed with many rivers and water bodies, a long stretch of coastline highly favorable for maritime trade, and vast tracts of highly fertile lands Odisha is known to the world as a poor state because of some reasons
    • Odisha’s per capita income is much below the national average. Odisha has 96 thousand Indian rupees per capita in the financial year 2019 against 135 thousand rupees of national average.
    • Odisha is second among 14 states with the highest incidence of poverty.

    • Only 2 per cent of households in Odisha have access to piped drinking water.
    • Only 28 per cent of the total road length in the state is surfaced (as compared to 90 per cent in Punjab and Haryana). 
    • More than 50 per cent of the villages don’t have all-weather roads, as a result of which farmers cannot transport their produce to the markets and don’t get remunerative prices
    • The mega investment came through Posco and Arcelor Mittal could not Materialized due to land and other issue.
    • Odisha was one of the first states to be explored by IT (information technology) giants like Infosys and Satyam but due to many infrastructure and related issues, the IT majors shifted their operations to other states.

    • Government has so many policy and projects for the development of the people but due to lack of proper implementation on the ground, the people cannot grow and the state as well.
    • Ease of doing business is not properly encouraged in the state. According to NITIAYOG Report, in Odisha, not even 32 per cent enterprises have availed the benefit of the State’s much-touted Single Window System owing to poor implementation on the ground. Also, only 22 per cent enterprises in the State have any knowledge about their environment category and, thereby, the State finished second from bottom. Moreover, in access to finance by enterprises in Odisha, the State’s entrepreneurs did speak of greater amount of obstacle in access to institutional finance

"The BCCI has shortlisted Gautam Gambhir and W.V. Raman for the new head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, set to start their role from the Sri Lanka series beginning July 27. This follows India's T20 World Cup win and marks the end of Rahul Dravid's tenure."
"India's head coach Rahul Dravid after India won the ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup Final match against South Africa at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Saturday, June 29, 2024."
"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary, Jay Shah announced on Monday that the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) has shortlisted two names for the men's team head coach role. The final decision is expected to be made soon, marking the end of Rahul Dravid's tenure as head coach."
"The Indian cricket team is set to welcome a new head coach for the upcoming limited-overs series in Sri Lanka, commencing later this month as former opener Gautam Gambhir and former India women's coach W.V. Raman are in contention for the prestigious role."
"Shah, currently in the Caribbean celebrating India's recent T20 World Cup victory, confirmed that the new coach would take charge from the Sri Lanka series beginning on July 27."
"""Both the coach and selector appointments will be made shortly. The CAC has conducted interviews and shortlisted two names. We will finalize the decision once we return to Mumbai,"" Shah said in the press conference."
"He also mentioned that VVS Laxman would be coaching the team for the Zimbabwe tour starting July 6, but the new head coach would join from the Sri Lanka series. ""VVS Laxman is going to Zimbabwe but new coach will join from Sri Lanka series."""
"India's recent triumph in the T20 World Cup, where they clinched the title by defeating South Africa by seven runs in a nail-biting final, was a momentous occasion. The victory ended an 11-year drought of ICC titles for India, a feat that Shah attributed to the experience and dedication of senior players like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Both stalwarts, along with all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, announced their retirement from T20 Internationals after the World Cup win."
"Reflecting on the win, Shah said, ""We had the same captain last year and here in Barbados. We worked harder and played better to win the title this time. Experience makes a significant difference in World Cups, and our seniors excelled when it mattered the most."""
"With the retirement of Rohit, Kohli, and Jadeja, India is on the brink of a new era. Shah is confident about the transition, emphasizing the strength and depth of India's bench. ""Transition has already happened with three greats retiring,"" he said. ""We have the biggest bench strength. Only three players from this team are going to Zimbabwe. We can field three teams if the need arises."""
"Shah also expressed optimism about India's future prospects, highlighting the goal of winning the World Test Championship final and the Champions Trophy. ""I want India to win all titles. The way this team is progressing, we aim to win the World Test Championship final and Champions Trophy. The seniors will be there to guide the team."""
"Addressing questions about Hardik Pandya's future as a potential captain, Shah noted Pandya's impressive all-round performance in the World Cup. ""Captaincy will be decided by the selectors. Hardik has proven himself, and we have faith in his abilities."""
"The BCCI is planning a felicitation for the victorious squad once they return to India. However, due to a hurricane warning shutting down the airport in Barbados indefinitely, the team is currently stranded. ""We are also stuck here. Once the travel plans are clear, we will think about the felicitation,"" Shah added."

"Ratna Bhandar, the treasure trove of Lord Jagannath, will be opened soon, said Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi on Sunday. He said this while addressing a special function organised in Bhubaneswar to felicitate newly elected BJP MPs and MLAs."
Politics in Odisha has intensified with the BJD joining opposition protests over NEET in the Rajya Sabha and raising concerns about Odia identity following their 2024 election defeat. The BJP criticizes BJD's actions as attempts to regain lost relevance.
The focus of the meeting was the fulfillment of all the earlier assurances promised by the saffron party in its election manifesto.
Vaishnaw further informed that Odisha will get new projects worth Rs 1 lakh crore in the next five years.
"Kanchana Nayak, a bedridden woman in Balasore, has appealed to Chief Minister Mohan Majhi for euthanasia due to acute poverty and unbearable pain. Living alone for 35 years, her condition worsened after a leg injury. With no means of support, she seeks mercy through social media."

"Balle Balle Dhaba and Family Restaurant in Jajpur was vacated after an investigation revealed misuse of MPLAD and MLALAD funds. Allegedly managed by former MLA Pranab Balabantaray, the dhaba was leased to a BJD leader without proper documentation. Current MLA Himanshu Sahu exposed the irregularity."
"In response to the land row, Revenue Minister Suresh Pujari said that the Revenue Department has been directed to initiate an inquiry and submit a detailed report into the matter."
"A fake doctor, Padmanabha Mukhi Karua, was arrested for treating patients at Rourkela Government Hospital using a false certificate. Despite a history of similar offenses, he worked undetected for seven months. Authorities are investigating how he evaded detection and the hospital's hiring practices."
The devotees are only allowed to get a glimpse of Lord Jagannath through an iron grille that has been put at a distance of 50 ft from the entrance gate. They only get the opportunity of Lord’s darshan during Rath Yatra.
"IAS officer Manoj Ahuja was appointed as the new chief secretary of Odisha, replacing Pradeep Kumar Jena."
"The Biju Patnaik International Airport (BPIA) in Bhubaneswar may soon be privatised.As per reports published in some sections of national media, as many as 11 airports across the country may be privately managed soon."
"With the idols of 'Parsva' Deities (side deities/Ratha Sakhis) of the three chariots in Puri being damaged by termites due to lack of proper maintenance, servitors demanded the establishment of a museum for their conservation."

"It was a historic moment as India lifted the Men's T20 World Cup yesterday in Barbados. A riot of emotions overflowed as the captain Rohit Sharma and legend Virat Kohli could not hold back their tears. New York too joined the celebrations chanting, 'Ganapati Bappa Moraya.'"
"New York city, Rohit Sharma with T20 World Cup trophy"
It was a historic moment as India lifted the T20 World Cup yesterday in Barbados. A riot of emotions overflowed as the captain Rohit Sharma and legend Virat Kohli could not hold back their tears. The last few overs were crucial and Indian fans in the stadium and the world over awaited with bated breath the final outcome.
"Just as Indians were watching this important final between India and South Africa on their television or the big squares on giant screens, Indian fans in New York were hooting on streets supporting the Indian cricketers with full enthusiasm. Towards the end of the match, as Jasprit Bumrah gave a major breakthrough by taking a wicket, fans in the US got excited and started chanting, “Ganapati Bappa Moraya.”"
Hundreds of fans joined this celebration on the streets in NYC as they waited till the last ball for India to clinch the trophy.
A post shared by Varinder Chawla (@varindertchawla)
"It was an emotional moment for every member of the Indian team. For Coach Rahul Dravid who left the captaincy in 2007 because India lost the match in the World Cup, it was a dream come true to lift the trophy that eluded him more than 15 years ago."
Virat Kohli was overjoyed as he lifted the trophy and walked around the ground wrapped in Indian tricolour posing and interacting with the media. The moment was overwhelming for him as could be seen from his reactions while he was talking with his family on video call. The legendary cricketer who has ruled Indian cricket announced retirement from T20 cricket yesterday.
"Although it was a bit saddening for his fans it was heartening as well that the legend is taking retirement from this format after winning the World Cup. For Rohit Sharma , it was a must-win situation after India lost the World Cup last year in November. The way he reacted after the last ball was hit exemplified how important this win was for him as a captain. He too announced his retirement from T20 format."
"Imagine at 11:30 today, Ravi Shastri with his full voice, “Rohit finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd! India lifts the World Cup after 13 years!” And Indians flock to the streets like this! pic.twitter.com/qFPJqfAY15"
"After 13 long years, India lifts the World Cup again! Cricket isn’t just a game for us, it’s an emotion, a heartbeat that unites millions🇮🇳               And this is how we celebrated last night🏆               Yes, that’s me playing the Dhol! #WorldCup2024 #T20IWorldCup pic.twitter.com/TX4nAHsxWZ"
"#WATCH | Maharashtra: As India lifts the T20 World Cup trophy for second time, fans cheer and celebrate                (Visuals from Pune) pic.twitter.com/6n9Tg0r5m4"
Indians were awake late till midnight watching India lift the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. Celebrations started as India emerged winners with streets in many metro cities flooded with people shouting slogans and flaring the Indian tricolour.

"The article discusses the dual-edged nature of journalists' access to politicians. While close relationships can yield exclusive stories and social prestige, they often compromise journalistic objectivity and credibility. The author reflects on his career, emphasizing the value of maintaining professional distance for unbiased reporting."
Media Ethics and the Eternal ‘Proximity Vs. Objectivity’ Debate
"Access to top politicians is an essential requirement for a journalist. It gives you information, inside dope and insight that helps you do your job better. If you are ‘close’ to the powers that be, it gives you a better chance of getting info that others are not privy to and thus helps you do an ‘exclusive’ that keeps you ahead of your rivals. The snob value that you get by flaunting your proximity to the rulers is an important fringe benefit. When the Chief Minister or a top minister lands at your marriage ceremony or that of your son/daughter, it raises your profile among those who know you!"
"But there is also a flip side to it. Turning the adage “Familiarity breeds contempt” upside down, ‘familiarity’ often breeds a cozy relationship with political leaders that clouds your judgment, colours your sense of fair play and evenhandedness and adversely affects your reportage - wittingly or unwittingly. Over time, such relationships inevitably turn into a ‘give and take’ arrangement that proves mutually beneficial for both sides. The politician gets the kind of coverage s/he wants. The journalist, in turn, gets what s/he wants – whether in terms of fringe benefits, bragging rights or something else. Before s/he realizes, the journalist gets branded as that particular leader’s stooge – the ultimate slur for any self-respecting scribe."
"Watching pictures and videos of some leading journalists, some with bouquets in hand, paying their ‘courtesy calls’ to the new Chief Minister, Mohan Charan Majhi, I wondered why journalists, with camerapersons in tow, should pay courtesy calls to the new CM in the first place? Meeting the new CM as part of a group of journalists, with or without affiliation to a journalists’ union, is understandable. There are several issues of interest to journalists – most of them spillovers from the last government – that have to do with creation of a proper environment for the media to operate freely, fairly and uninhibitedly. And these issues need to be discussed and thrashed out with the new dispensation as it settles down to the task of governance. But why on earth does an individual journalist need a ‘photo op’ with the new CM? Far from enhancing their bragging rights, such ‘photo ops’ actually demean the journalist concerned in the public eye, more so when those paying their respects to the new star on the horizon have been known as apologists of the ancien regime."
"If proximity to politicians impairs your power of judgment, distance gives you a measure of clarity and objectivity. Writing objectively and dispassionately about someone becomes difficult when you know the person well. Even when you consciously try not to allow your personal relationship to come in the way of your reporting/writing, there is always a possibility your bias would creep into the story one way or the other without you realizing it. If you consciously go to the other extreme and be harsh on the politician, you run the risk of spoiling your relationship with the person because no politician would have someone in his/her list of ‘friends’ who writes disparagingly about him/her. In doing so, you not only burn your ‘source’ cultivated over years but also lose your bragging rights. Hence, instead of burning their bridges, most journalists prefer to keep singing hosannas to the leader, even at the cost of their own credibility and the respect of the concerned politician. A lesser known or unknown journalist who writes objectively, in contrast, is likely to command greater respect from the politician than someone who only sings paeans to him/her."
"This ‘Access Vs Objectivity’ tug of war has occupied my mindspace right through my career as a journalist lasting nearly four decades now. By instinct and by inclination, I have always been rather averse to getting close to the powers that be. The price that I have had to pay for this innate disinterest is that there are not many politicians who know me well personally. As a result, I haven’t got too many ‘breaking news’ stuff, especially of the political kind. I have no pictures with political VIPs adorning my drawing room wall to boast about nor selfies with them to share on social media. No political stalwart has ever come to a family do or invited me to his/her family do. But believe me, I have never faced a problem in getting an interview – or a byte – with any politician in connection with a story in the last three decades – with the exception of outgoing Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik."
"Mercifully, I am past my active reporting days when lack of access/proximity to the Who’s Who of Odisha politics used to be a big handicap and showed me up as a ‘good for nothing’ journalist for family, friends and acquaintances. But I have never really regretted not having too many ‘friends’ among politicians. I am perfectly happy doing what I am doing: trying to write as fairly and objectively as humanly possible – from a ‘safe’ distance!"

Pani Puri
"A few months after Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry governments banned the sale and consumption of cotton candy, food safety officials found cancer-causing chemicals in Pani Puris sold in Karnataka. Shockingly, 22% of the pani puri samples collected failed the safety standards."
The shocking results after testing the samples have left food lovers stunned. At least 260 samples were collected by food safety officials. The officials found artificial colours and carcinogenic agents that cause cancer in at least 41 samples of the 260 collected samples.
"Chemicals like brilliant blue, sunset yellow, and tartrazine were found in Pani Puri samples which can potentially cause various health issues."
"Moreover, another 18 samples were even found unfit for human consumption."
"“We received many complaints about the substandard quality of pani puri that is served in streets across the state. We collected samples from roadside stalls to decent restaurants from all over the state. Many samples were found in a stale state and unfit for human consumption,” Deccan Herald quoted Srinivas K, commissioner of food safety."
"Earlier, the Karnataka government had banned colouring of food using Rhodamine-B, which is widely used in dishes such as gobi Manchurian and cotton candy. When contacted, Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao warned that strict action will be taken if sellers were found using the chemicals."
"“Food safety in the state is our priority, and we will be inspecting more dishes to find out what colouring agents are being used in them. People should be aware of what kind of food they are consuming. The restaurant owners must also be responsible enough to maintain hygiene. Otherwise, strict action will be taken,” Rao stated."

"Ratna Bhandar, the treasure trove of Lord Jagannath, will be opened soon, said Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi on Sunday. He said this while addressing a special function organised in Bhubaneswar to felicitate newly elected BJP MPs and MLAs."
"The newly-elected BJP government in Odisha, under CM Mohan Majhi, has revived the public grievance cell after several years. Citizens from across the state are now able to present their issues directly to the CM. This marks a shift from the previous administration under Naveen Patnaik."
"The Subhadra Yojana will be launched on September 17, coinciding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Majhi announced that PM Modi will visit Odisha to launch the yojana in the presence of five lakh women."
"Odisha CM Mohan Charan Majhi led a major yoga session in Bhubaneswar's Kalinga Stadium to celebrate the 10th International Day of Yoga, emphasizing its benefits for personal and societal health. The event, attended by various dignitaries and celebrities, aimed to inspire widespread adoption of yoga across the state."
"Mohan Majhi, recently appointed as the Chief Minister, faces criticism alleging he was chosen to facilitate iron ore exploitation in Keonjhar, Odisha by Ambani and Adani. Critics ignore past unchecked mining abuses and instead focus on vilifying Majhi without awaiting his administrative actions."
"The article discusses the political tenure of Naveen Patnaik, focusing on both his intangible and tangible contributions to Odisha. It contrasts these achievements with perceived administrative shortcomings and critiques, culminating in the BJP's electoral victory which ended Patnaik's long-standing rule."
"A large number of dignitaries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, JP Nadda, Rajnath Singh and Chief Ministers of several states including Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma attended the ceremony."
"Mohan Majhi, the first BJP Chief Minister of Odisha, is set to be sworn in after a tumultuous journey marked by a bomb attack and police misbehavior. Previously serving as a Sarpanch, the four-time MLA from Keonjhar has been known for his dedication to public service."
"Mohan Majhi's historic oath-taking as the first BJP CM of Odisha is scheduled to be held today at Janata Maidan, Bhubaneswar, with PM Modi and other dignitaries attending. The event marks a significant shift after BJP's victory over the long-ruling BJD."
"Mohan Majhi, designated as Odisha's new Chief Minister, assured a peon of addressing his grievances, emphasizing a government focused on the poor. Even before his official swearing-in, he pledged to prioritize the basic needs under PM Modi's double-engine BJP government."
Mohan Charan Majhi's name was announced as the Chief Minister of Odisha after the BJP legislature party meeting held in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.
Senior party leader Mohan Majhi will be BJP's first Chief Minister in the State. The decision was taken by central observers Rajnath Singh and Bhupender Yadav. The saffron party had appointed both the Union Ministers to oversee the selection of the new Chief Minister.
"A delegation of the BJP comprising newly-elected MLAs Pravati Parida, Prithviraj Harichandan, Ashrit Pattanayak and Irasis Acharya sought blessings from Lord Jagannath for the new journey of Odisha’s development."
"A special security meeting in this regard was held by the Commissionerate of Police on Tuesday. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah along with other dignitaries will be present during the oath-taking ceremony, massive security cover will be in place for the grand event."

"India won the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup after a gripping final against South Africa at Kensington Oval. The victory ended an 11-year wait for a major trophy, sparking joyous celebrations across the nation. Key players like Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, and Virat Kohli were visibly emotional as they celebrated this historic win."
Team India's T20 World Cup victory:  A reminder of how cricket & emotions are a great unifying force!
"When Anrich Nortje’s heave off Arshdeep Singh on the last ball of South Africa’s innings went to the mid-wicket fielder for a single, Rohit Sharma fell flat, with his face towards the ground and punching the grass with his hand. Hardik Pandya went down on his knees and began to tear up once the inevitable -– of India winning the 2024 Men’s T20 World Cup -- was confirmed a little after 2 pm at the Kensington Oval."
"Soon after, the entire Indian team, and support staff running in from the dugout began the jumping and hugging of lifting a major trophy after 11 years. A full 13 years after the magical night of April 2, 2011, at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to lift the ODI World Cup and 17 years since the unprecedented evening of winning the T20 World Cup in 2007, India got to experience that feeling all over again on June 29, 2024."
"The skies, which were supposed to rain during the final amidst a hurricane warning, opened and made one feel as if the weather Gods were waiting for a billion dreams and prayers to be fulfilled. Cheeks welled down the eyes of adults like Rohit, Pandya, and Virat Kohli, who broke down, as years of heartbreaks when it mattered the most finally on previous occasions made way for ultimate glory."
"The theme song of this T20 World Cup was all about experiencing a moment their souls had been waiting for. It was very fitting that India got to revel in the ‘out of this world’ feeling at the end of the competition. Back home, the party began on the streets of every city and town."
"India Gate in New Delhi – the hometown of Virat Kohli and Rishabh Pant - was choc-a-bloc, with thousands of people coming out and unfurling flags as well as smoke guns -– some even stood atop the police van to dance and sing over the T20 World Cup coming home. The chants ranged from, ‘India, India, India’, to ‘Jeet Gaya bhai Jeet Gaya, India World Cup jeet gaya’, ‘Humara captain kaisa ho, Rohit bhai jaisa ho’, ‘Surya, Surya, Surya’."
"There were some grateful people who thanked God by saying, ‘Zor se bolo jai mata di’. In Mumbai, the residences of Rohit, Pandya, and Suryakumar Yadav -- it was a sea of utter jubilation filled with fans coming out in large numbers to celebrate the triumph."
"In Mumbai’s local trains, people glued to their mobiles clapped in unison, while a sangeeth ceremony turned into a World Cup win celebration party. Similar scenes of ecstatic frenzy came from the streets of Ahmedabad, Nadiad, and Hyderabad – hometowns of Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel, and Mohammed Siraj respectively."
"“Everybody was elated and they just started jumping and shouting that 'at last, we have got the World Cup back. The celebrations from the 2007 World Cup triumph in Johannesburg after Joginder Sharma’s last over was done were just going on through my mind when Hardik Pandya bowled the final over,” says Lalchand Rajput, the manager in India’s 2007 T20 World Cup triumph, to IANS from Mumbai."
"You couldn’t fault the Indian fans for getting that sinking feeling in their mind and heart when 30 runs were needed for South Africa to win off 30 deliveries. An on-song Heinrich Klaasen took 24 runs off the last over off Axar Patel. The win predictors gave India just a 3% chance to win the final, making a South African victory a foregone conclusion."
"The Indian fans, mainly Gen Z fans, had their heart rate racing with the feeling that the trophy may be missed again. A tiny part of them had the belief of the side conjuring up a miracle outta nowhere – remember how on a shining afternoon in New York, they defended 119 against Pakistan on a tough pitch?"
"Once Pandya took out Heinrich Klaasen, Bumrah took out Marco Jansen and Suryakumar Yadav took a ‘hang-it-in-the-louvre’ catch for ages of David Miller, it began to hit home that a World Cup win for India wasn’t far after years and years of heartbreaks and that emotion of winning a big final is something they will carry for the rest of their lives."
"Seeing adults –- highly-revered professional cricketers -- cry and roar in ecstasy on realising the pure joy of winning the World Cup and becoming champions, it was a pure feeling and emotion which had the entire country tear up and be happy in the happiness of their idols."
"“Somewhere down the line, I had this feeling that ‘Yeah, it is ours’. So, I was very assured that India is going to win. I knew it. There was no tension. Firecrackers were burst, and people were going crazy, driving rickshaws around the colony, and blaring music. My aged father-in-law and my wife were discussing cricket till 4 a.m., and they didn't let me sleep,” recalled Biju George, the Delhi Capitals’ fielding coach, to IANS from Thiruvananthapuram."
"For many years, despite the riches and vastness of domestic structure, a major trophy eluded Indian cricket, raising questions over its ability to cross the final hurdle. Off the field, toxic fan wars, and trolling of certain players based on their religion made things horrible."
"It became worse when Pandya’s incessant trolling in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 didn’t have a full stop. On social media, when cricket, IPL, and T20 World Cup action dominated headlines in posts and reels, other issues related to the common man in India also grabbed headlines. But June 29, 2024, united the entire India with an electric and genuine feeling of nothing in the country bringing people together like cricket does."
"“At least cricket is one unifying force in India where we are not divided. You don't say things like you are a Muslim or a Hindu or a Christian. We are cricketers basically, and at least that is one thing which politics has been kept away from,” adds George."
"It's already two days since the triumph was achieved at Barbados and people in the country haven’t stopped talking about the win, the runs from Kohli, Axar, and Shivam Dube. They don’t feel tired of talking about how Bumrah, Pandya, and Arshdeep Singh kept their calm in the last five overs. They can’t get over how Suryakumar unleashed the Superman and Ballerina in him to take a catch for ages."
"Every time they open social media, pictures captioned with ‘woke up as world champions’, and ‘this feels so good’ gladden their feed. Algorithms are buzzing with reels of Rohit doing Ric Flair strut to lift the title, players walking with trophy aloft, Virat and Arshdeep doing bhangra while sharing this special moment with their families in person or virtually come up, reminding fans of the feeling they forgot to cherish in these 13 years."
"For the next few days, months, and years, the glory moment and on-field celebrations thereafter will be played on a loop on television sets in India and social media plus YouTube screens."
"Whenever it pops up, everything else will be forgotten as fans get their minds, hearts, and souls drawn to that winning emotion, serving as a sweet reminder that cricket and emotions are a great unifying force in India, which anything else can’t ever come close to replicating it in this part of the world."

"Health experts reassure that the new Covid-19 variants, nicknamed FLiRT, do not warrant panic despite being more transmissible and immune-evasive compared to previous strains. The symptoms are similar to earlier versions, with low hospitalization rates expected."
"Concerns arise as Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is linked to rare side effects like Thrombosis. Actor Shreyas Talpade speculates his cardiac arrest may be related to the vaccine. A couple claims their daughter died due to Covishield, planning to sue the makers."
"AstraZeneca acknowledged that its Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, might cause rare side effects like blood clots and low platelet counts. This admission came during a UK court case where victims are seeking damages. Developed with Oxford University and sold globally, the vaccine's safety has led to its suspension in the UK."
"In most countries, respiratory illnesses were perceived to be a more serious problem than Covid."
This comes even as the country is under the grip of the new highly transmissible JN.1 variant with immune escaping features.
"Two deaths -- one each from Tamil Nadu and Gujarat -- were reported in a span of 24 hours, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 am."

The country had recorded 865 new cases on May 19.
"JN.1, from the lineage of Omicron, was first detected in August and is currently present in over 40 countries."
"India has logged 636 new cases of COVID-19, while the number of active cases of the infection have increased to 4,394, the health ministry said on Monday."
"Three new fatalities -- one each from Kerala, Karnataka and Bihar -- have been reported in the span of 24 hours, according to the ministry's data."
"The rising cases of daily Covid-19 infections across the country is said to be majorly driven by the JN.1 sub variant. As of now, the country has reportedly detected about 145 cases of JN.1 variant from eight states."
"In the past 24 hours, India has recorded 743 new COVID-19 cases, 54 cases less from Friday, while current number of active cases stands at 3,997."

"A Bengaluru Ola cab driver's daily earnings of Rs 3000-4000 have sparked a lively debate on social media. The driver's disclosure has ignited discussions about the financial viability of various jobs, including street food vendors and educated professionals."
Driving pic for representational purpose
A Bengaluru cab driver has caught the attention of social media after he disclosed his daily earnings to a curious passenger. He revealed that he earns around Rs 3000 to Rs 4000 per day and also earns extras by driving Ola cabs.
"The Bengaluru cab driver’s salary has left the internet stunned which has sparked a debate on the money earned by educated people and other daily works like driving, selling gup chups, momos and many other such street foods."
"Taking to his Reddit handle, the passenger shared, “So, I was coming back from a function today, and I booked a cab. While chatting with the cab driver, I asked him about his earnings. He mentioned that he makes around 3000 to 4000 per day.”"
"He further added, “I was shocked! If he makes 3000 per day and works for 25 days a month, that totals to 75,000 per month. He added that even after deducting petrol costs, he still has enough money. Plus, he has another cab attached to Ola, which brings in additional income. He proudly mentioned that his kids go to a good school. When I asked him how long he's been driving, he said since 2019, after he lost his previous job.”"
As expected his post went viral with different reactions from netizens.
"“One cab driver (attached to two companies) makes 79k + 59k for 4 shifts (pickups or drops) a day and 6 days a week. The best thing was his timing and proximity. Drop and pick up are scheduled to nearby places with less time gap. Between the shifts, he goes home, has home food (all 3 meals at home). Good guy as well!!” shared a user."
"Another user shared, “This is pretty reasonable and believable. I have a close friend’s brother who works as OLA driver. He usually just focuses on airport or railway station pickups. Works a bit odd hours. But comfortably brings home around 80k after expenses (fuel, EMI, maintenance and insurance). He leads a pretty comfortable life and has a 30/40 home at Yelahanka and a couple of acres of land in native which he bought with his cab earnings.”"
"“During Ola Uber's initial days cab drivers used to make 1 lakh plus a month. Many of them who did it in the initial days made a good amount of money, bought agricultural lands in their hometowns and now they are leading a good life there,” shared another user."

"As per reports, the incident was captured on the streets of Chiplun in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri. It is believed that the crocodile was washed away from the nearby Shiva river after heavy rainfall lashed the district."
"In the viral video, a commuter can be seen recording the crocodile on a mobile camera as it crawls to the side of the road. While one auto-rickshaw passes by the crocodile, another auto-rickshaw driver turns his vehicle and follows the reptile. He is seen recording the video of the crocodile with his mobile camera."
"The entire incident was captured by a person sitting inside a four-wheeler and as the crocodile approached close, he moved back. Well, the crocodile widens its mouth while crossing the road and it seems, it gets annoyed after the auto-rickshaw follows from behind."

Parts of Rahul Gandhi's speech in the Lok Sabha during a discussion on the President's Address on July 1 have been expunged.
The portions expunged include his comments on Hindus and others.
Rahul Gandhi’s maiden speech as the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha was marked by huge pandemonium and uproar on Monday.
"Starting his speech, the Congress MP waved a copy of the Constitution and also the photo of Lord Shiva while launching a broadside at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)."
Rahul Gandhi’s reference to Hindus drew strong protest from the BJP MPs and also a rare intervention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"PM Modi stood up to interject the Congress MP and said, “Calling the entire Hindu community violent is a very serious matter.”"
Home Minister Amit Shah demanded an apology from the Congress MP for ‘linking’ the BJP with violence.
The Home Minister also took strong exception to Rahul Gandhi’s analogy of ‘violent Hindus’ with the BJP and demanded that the Congress leader tender an apology.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that Digital India symbolizes an empowered nation by enhancing 'Ease of Living' and transparency. Celebrating nine years of the initiative, Modi highlighted the country's advancements in digital payments and public infrastructure, making it a global fintech leader."
Digital India symbolises an empowered nation: PM Modi
"Digital India symbolises an empowered country which boosts 'Ease of Living' and transparency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday."
"The Prime Minister lauded the successful completion of nine years of the ‘Digital India initiative’, which was launched on July 1, 2015."
"Sharing a thread on X by MyGovIndia, the Prime Minister wrote: “A Digital India is an empowered India, boosting 'Ease of Living' and transparency. This thread gives a glimpse of the strides made in a decade thanks to the effective usage of technology.”"
"MyGovIndia said in a post that from revolutionising digital payments to becoming the fastest-growing digital economy, India's journey in the past nine years has been nothing short of extraordinary."
"“The ‘Digital India’ initiative, spearheaded by the PM Modi government, has transformed the nation's digital landscape."
"“India's trajectory exemplifies that Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) is a fundamental driver of social transformation and progress,” MyGovIndia posted."
The country has become a leading global fintech ecosystem thanks to robust digital public infrastructure (DPI) models like unified payments interface (UPI).
"Several countries are ready to embrace the 'India Stack' solutions to empower the masses, PM Modi told IANS in May."
"The Prime Minister said that when he kicked off the 'Digital India' movement, opposition parties made allegations that this was being done to serve the needs of the service providers."
"""They could not understand how big this area is and the 21st century is a technology-driven century. Moreover, technology today is driven by artificial intelligence (AI),"" PM Modi had told IANS."

"Mohan Majhi, recently appointed as the Chief Minister, faces criticism alleging he was chosen to facilitate iron ore exploitation in Keonjhar, Odisha by Ambani and Adani. Critics ignore past unchecked mining abuses and instead focus on vilifying Majhi without awaiting his administrative actions."
"The article discusses the political tenure of Naveen Patnaik, focusing on both his intangible and tangible contributions to Odisha. It contrasts these achievements with perceived administrative shortcomings and critiques, culminating in the BJP's electoral victory which ended Patnaik's long-standing rule."
"The article discusses the dual-edged nature of journalists' access to politicians. While close relationships can yield exclusive stories and social prestige, they often compromise journalistic objectivity and credibility. The author reflects on his career, emphasizing the value of maintaining professional distance for unbiased reporting."
"Mohan Majhi's new government started well with initial actions like opening Lok Seva Bhavan to journalists and Lord Jagannath temple to the public. However, issues arose with delayed portfolio allocations and excessive bureaucratic control, suggesting need for democratic reforms and better leadership distribution."
"VK Pandian, once a significant figure in Odisha's politics supported by Naveen Patnaik, has declared his withdrawal from active politics after a brief 195-day career marked by controversy and electoral defeat. Despite his past influence, his future in politics appears dim as he navigates challenges from an incoming BJP government."
"The article reflects on Naveen Patnaik's political tenure as he steps down, critiquing his governance and its impact on Odia culture and politics. It highlights his manipulative political strategies, possible corruption, and the perceived betrayal by his trusted aide, alongside the disillusionment with his secular claims."
"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik clarified that VK Pandian is not his successor, aiming to quell rumors and manage the damage this speculation caused to BJD's election prospects. Despite the announcement, skepticism remains among voters as BJD faces significant challenges in the ongoing elections."
"The Biju Janata Dal faced multiple setbacks, including PM Modi's aggressive campaign claims, a CCTV revelation clearing BJP's Prashant Jagdev of EVM tampering, and DS Kutte's suspension by the Election Commission for election interference."
"The article explores various aspects of employee retention, highlighting behavioral issues at work and the importance of a comprehensive hiring process. It discusses the need for values, attitude, and learning ability assessments during selection to ensure long-term organizational fit and reduce turnover."
"In Odisha, a significant number of people oppose regime change, fearing the BJP's potential for exacerbating communal tensions and authoritarian practices. Despite Naveen Patnaik's long tenure marked by various governance issues, many prefer the known challenges over the risks of BJP rule. This resistance spans from those benefiting from Patnaik’s patronage to those fearing unknown political shifts."
"Despite serving as the Chief Minister of Odisha for over 24 years, Naveen Patnaik's refusal to speak Odia has surprisingly never been a major public or political issue. Only recently has the BJP highlighted this in their campaign, amidst Patnaik's potential succession plans and his significant political longevity without mastering the state's language."
Criticism is directed towards the practice of 'star' reporters overshadowing local journalists during significant events like elections. It points out the inequities and financial impracticalities of this system.
The political battle intensifies in Odisha as PM Narendra Modi and CM Naveen Patnaik exchange sharp criticisms during their respective campaigns.
"From psephologists to astrologers, from journalists to the common man – no one is really immune to this typically Indian ‘disease’ of foretelling the election results before the actual results come in."
"In a dramatic prelude to the Odisha elections, both Narendra Modi and Kartik Pandian announced swearing-in dates for their respective parties before any votes were cast. The BJD is dealing with internal conflicts and anti-incumbency after 24 years in power, while the BJP targets Kartik Pandian's non-Odia origins in their campaign."

"The popular TV show Anupamaa continues to engage viewers with dramatic twists. The current plot focuses on Dimpy and Titur's wedding, with Vanraj attempting to sabotage the event while Anupama tries to save it. Meanwhile, Gaurav Khanna's shocking transformation photo has sparked speculation and concern among fans about the show's future direction."
Anupamaa takes dramatic turn: Anuj Kapadia's new look leaves fans worried about his role
"Anupamaa, starring Rupali Ganguly, continues to generate excitement among viewers. The current storyline features Dimpy and Titu’s wedding, with Vanraj trying to disrupt the event while Anupama aims to save it."
"Meanwhile, Shruti has returned to the US, urging Anuj and Anupama to remarry. Amid these developments, Gaurav Khanna, who plays Anuj Kapadia, has shared a shocking photo of himself on social media."
"Anuj's recent declaration of love for Anu had fans anticipating a heartfelt reunion. However, the latest twist suggests otherwise."
"A viral image of Gaurav Khanna, showcasing a dramatic transformation, has left fans puzzled and concerned. The actor appears unrecognizable with grown hair and a beard, sparking speculation about the show's direction. The intense new look hints at a significant leap in the storyline, potentially altering Anu and Anuj's lives once again."
"This unexpected transformation has shocked netizens, leading to speculation that Anuj's character might become a beggar in upcoming episodes. However, there has been no official confirmation from the makers."
"Fans are anxious about this new development, with one user commenting, ""My brain is not brain-ing after this. If this is related to #Anupamaa show, then I feel something very scary is coming up for both Anuj & Anu. Ek din sukoon ko saans nahi le sakte while being this show's fan."""
"Another wrote, “They know to create a buzz and who can create buzz, but there must be something na. I don't think they will go for another leap this soon, or the best speculation I can get is may he is enacting an act to make aadhya understand so that she will accept anupama.”"

"Following the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, BJP-led NDA won 292 seats forming a coalition government with Janata Dal United and Telugu Desam Party. Nitish Kumar, known for switching alliances, rejoined the NDA, sparking numerous humorous memes on social media."
"Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal rebutted Rahul Gandhi's allegation of a 'biggest stock market scam', attributing it to election disappointment. He emphasized India's economic growth under Modi, projecting further rise in global ranking during Modi's potential third term."

Hardik Pandya got emotional after India lifted the T20 World Cup 2024 a few days ago. He was seen video calling someone very close from the ground after the match.
"Natasa Stankovic, Hardik Pandya"
"It was a moment of joy for both the players and their families as India lifted the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. From Rohit Sharma cradling his daughter and hugging his wife to an emotional Virat Kohli video calling his family from the ground, everyone had special moments with their near ones after the win."
"Hardik Pandya who has been under the scanner for the last few months also got emotional and had tears in his eyes. He too was found video-calling someone after the match. While Anushka Sharma shared an emotional post for Virat Kohli after the win, there has been no post from Natasa Stankovic, wife of the Indian vice Captain of the T20 World Cup team."
"For the last few months, there have been rumours that all is not well between the couple. The rumours triggered after Hardik who was roped in as the captain of Mumbai Indians in place of Rohit Sharma underperformed in IPL 2024. Natasa was trolled and criticized for this underperformance after netizens noticed that the Siberian model had removed the surname Pandya from her social media account."
A post shared by Voompla (@voompla)
"Amid the hype around the T20 World Cup, all the rumours about Hardik Pandya and Natasa Stankovic breakup were forgotten. Now suddenly after India's win fans have started pointing out how despite giving such a stunning performance in the finals there has been no post from Natasa appreciating Hardik Pandya. She used to post gracious comments on even IPL wins and performances of Hardik Pandya earlier. Importantly, the actress is very active even now on Instagram and keeps on posting regularly."
"HARDIK PANDYA - YOU CHAMPION!                An emotional speech by Hardik about his tough times, he redeemed himself like a true hero. 🫡🇮🇳pic.twitter.com/l8mwdyqqIs"
But she has not mentioned a single word about India's win or her husband which has led many netizens to speculate that the rumours about Hardik and Natasa split seem very much true.

At least eight workers are in critical condition following a carbon monoxide gas leak at Rourkela Steel Plant. The incident occurred during repair work at blast furnace number-5. Injured workers are receiving treatment in ICU at Ispat General Hospital.
"The matter came to the fore when Mukhi applied for a loan from a private company. Subsequently, Raghunathpali police detained him. Mukhi is being interrogated as part of the investigation."
The Director of the Health Services made it clear that all such cases can't be directly linked with sunstroke/heat strokes and the exact reasons for their death can only be ascertained by assessing the circumstantial inquiry and post-mortem reports.
"In Rourkela, two more deaths at the Government Hospital raise the suspected heatstroke death toll to 16 in Sundargarh District. Authorities are transferring critical patients to Hi-Tech Hospital in Bhubaneswar as preventive steps continue."
"Superintendent of the RGH, Sudharani Pradhan informed that eight of the persons were received dead while two others died after reaching the hospital. “It has not been established that they have died of heatstroke. That has happened for unknown reasons. We are unable to give their history,” she said."
"While doctors claimed brain haemorrhage caused by high blood pressure to be the possible reason of the UTP's death, family members alleged torture inside jail to be the reason behind his death."
The BJP has fielded its heavyweight and three-time MLA Dilip Ray against BJD’s Sarada Prasanna Nayak. The Congress has fielded Birendranath Patnaik.
"Officials of the district administration, senior police officials and representatives of 58 Akhada committees were present at the meeting which was presided over by the Rourkela SP. Traffic management and procession timings were discussed at the meeting."
"Dilip Ray told the media, ""No leader of Odisha has been received by people like I was received here. I am really emotional over such a warm welcome. The people have handed me victory even without contesting elections.”"
"The accused has been identified as Kadam Sadashiv, a resident of Telangana. He allegedly posed himself as an RPF official on his Instagram account and managed to establish romantic relationships with some girls. Later the accused allegedly tricked the gullible girls into paying him handsomely."
"This came after Nandlal's wife who was undergoing treatment at Rourkela for the last three months died on March 20, 2024. Sources said Nandlal's wife sustained critical burn injuries while she was sitting beside a bonfire in January this year."
"On the wedding day, the woman and her family members, with all preparations, were waiting for Biranchi’s arrival but he didn’t turn up."
"The aide has been identified as Amir Ali. He was arrested from the Sector-3 area of Rourkela, informed Rourkela SP Mitrabhanu Mohapatra. The SP said that a Central team arrested Amir Ali on Wednesday night from Rourkela."
"According to his roommates, they were asleep when he left the room late at night. Later, his friends and other hostel mates spotted his dead body lying in a pool of blood early Sunday morning."
"The entire incident has been caught in the CCTV camera installed inside the office. The involvement of locals behind the robbery is suspected. However, there has been no official confirmation in this regard."

However, the next day, Dubai-based popular YouTuber Khalid AI Ameri liked the post on June 6 and posted a similar post of a couple holding each other's hand, with a diamond ring on the girl's finger. Now, reports are abuzz that Sunaina is engaged to Khalid AI Ameri and is set to get married soon."

A post shared by Khalid Al Ameri (@khalidalameri)
"After the duo shared their respective posts on social media, congratulatory messages flooded the comments section. Though the duo hasn't yet made an official announcement about their engagement, speculations are rife that they will get married by the end of this year. Moreover, even after reports surfaced about their engagement, both Sunaina and Khalid haven't reacted to it."
"While reports have been abuzz about Khalid and Sunaina's engagement, on July 1, Khalid's former wife, Salama Mohamed, revealed that she and Khalid were divorced. She revealed the same on the latest episode of NourAldin Alyousuf’s YouTube channel. During the show, she stated that their divorce was finalised on February 14 this year."
"Well, the revelations made by Salama have fueled the rumours of Khalid and Sunaina's engagement and wedding."
"Incidentally, Khalid is currently in Chennai as is evident from his Instagram post talking about a meet-up at a restaurant. Khalid is a good friend of Chennai-based YouTuber Irfan and had come to the city to attend his friend's wedding."
"For the unversed, Khalid and Salama were one of the popular influencer couples in the Middle East. Individually, they boasted millions of followers on social media."
"On the other hand, actress Sunaina primarily works in the Tamil film industry and has worked in many movies. She debuted in  2008's Kadhalil Vizhunthen, opposite actor Nakul. She was last seen in the Tamil crime thriller Inspector Rishi."

"Several migrant workers from Odisha's Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack and over eight from Kendrapara district are now stranded in Dubai. They were working plumbers in Dubai and have alleged mental and physical torture, unpaid salaries and passport confiscation. In a video message, they narrated their ordeal and revealed how they had been deprived of food for the last five days. The workers alleged that they were being made to work under extreme conditions for long hours without food and pay. Their passports have been allegedly confiscated by their employer who is threatening them with life. Through a video, the workers appealed to Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi and BJP National Vice-President and Kendrapara MP Baijayant Panda to rescue them immediately from the Gulf capital. According to sources, the workers from Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack were taken to Dubai to work as plumbers a month ago. A private agent from Bhubaneswar took them to Dubai on the false promise of better pay. However, the workers have alleged torture by their employer. They are not even able to return home as their passports have been confiscated, the workers alleged. Meanwhile, no comments could be obtained from the agent or their employer in this regard."

"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued a show-cause notice to Hindenburg Research, Nathan Anderson and the entities of Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investor (FPI) Mark Kingdon for trading violations in the scrip of Adani Enterprises Ltd, leading up to Hindenburg report and thereafter."
"In the 46-page show-cause notice, The markets regulator has alleged that Hindenburg and Anderson violated regulations under the SEBI Act, SEBI’s Prevention of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices regulations, and its Code of Conduct for Research Analyst regulations."
"Meanwhile, FPI Kingdon has allegedly violated SEBI Act, SEBI’s Prevention of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices regulations and SEBI’s Code of Conduct for Foreign Portfolio Investors, according to the show-cause notice."
The markets regulator pointed out that the Hindenburg and the FPI entities undertook a misleading disclaimer that the report was solely for the valuation of securities traded outside India when it clearly pertained to listed entities in India.
The regulator said Kingdon aided Hindenburg to indirectly participate in Adani Enterprises by collaborating with the short seller to trade in the company's futures in the Indian derivatives market and shared profits with the research firm.
Hindenburg continues to defend its report that came out in January 2023.

"Mohan Majhi, recently appointed as the Chief Minister, faces criticism alleging he was chosen to facilitate iron ore exploitation in Keonjhar, Odisha by Ambani and Adani. Critics ignore past unchecked mining abuses and instead focus on vilifying Majhi without awaiting his administrative actions."
"""Putting the Cart before the Horse"""
"Within minutes of Mohan Majhi being chosen as the leader of the BJP legislature party, I got a call from a politician, who left the BJP and joined the Congress just weeks before the election. ""Ambani and Adani have won,"" she announced triumphantly in an apparent reference to the stakes of the two business tycoons in Odisha in general and the enormous iron ore deposits in Keonjhar, Majhi's home district, in particular. In the time since then, variations of the same verdict have been played on social media ad nauseam with apologists of the ancient regime taking the lead. The insinuation: Majhi was chosen because he is an adivasi from Keonjhar and thus can be made to 'toe the line' and facilitate the easy handover of the iron ore mines to the two rapacious businessmen from Gujarat who have been allegedly propped up by the Narendra Modi regime right through its two terms."
"That the new Chief Minister has vowed to end 'mafia Raj' in Keonjhar hasn't made the slightest difference to those engaged in the vilification campaign against him. They will brook no questions on their verdict nor wait to see how the new CM acts. As far as they are concerned, the verdict is final, not subject to any review or appeal in a 'higher court'."
"In running a full-fledged motivated campaign against the new CM even before he has settled on his chair properly, these people are being unfair to him on two counts. First, they are trying to create an impression that had someone from outside Keonjhar been chosen as the CM, the mines in the district would be safe. This suggestion defies logic. If the Modi-Shah combination is determined to give Ambani and Adani a free run of the iron ore mines in Keonjhar, who in the state BJP has the guts to defy their orders as CM? What difference would it have made if the new CM belonged to say Sambalpur or Koraput district? Would s/he not do the same - facilitate the loot by the Ambani-Adani duo - assuming that Modi-Shah indeed want to hand over the rich iron ore mines in Keonjhar on a platter to their 'Gujju Bhais'? On the one hand, these people claim that the reins of the BJP government would be with the Big Two in Delhi, who would control everything with a remote. On the other, the same set of people say Majhi was chosen because he would be a pushover. How can one reconcile the two arguments that seem to be at loggerheads with each other?"
"Second, Majhi's tribal origins should not be mocked by insinuating that tribals are lesser mortals and can be pushed around to do one's bidding more easily than others. This, in my view, amounts to a casteist - and even racist - slur that deserves unqualified condemnation by one and all."
"Ironically, the same set of people who are now crying themselves hoarse - even before the new government has settled down and the anticipated loot has begun - never uttered a word against the rampant and uninhibited loot of iron ore from the mines in Keonjhar that continued unabated from 2000 to 2009. Their silence on the report of the MC Shah Commission of inquiry, which strongly recommended a CBI inquiry into the mega mining scam in the state, has been deafening. It is not as if the loot stopped after 2009. Mining companies still mine far more than their prescribed limit. They still foray into areas outside their leased area. And they still deny the exchequer what it should get by way of mining revenue. But no one has ever heard these people utter a word against it at any point in time. It seems they suddenly woke up to the loot only after the change of regime in the state."
"If we are serious about checking the loot of our mineral wealth, we should collectively work for a proper, fair and transparent probe into the mega mining scam of 2000-2009 and bring those responsible for it to book. And keep a vigilant eye on and monitor the operation of all mining activities in the state - not just in the iron-rich mines of Keonjhar, but also our enviable bauxite reserves in the southern districts of Rayagada, Korpaut and Kalahandi. If the Mohan Majhi government facilitates the loot of mines, with or without the Centre's behest, we should oppose it tooth and nail."
But crucifying the new government just days after it is sworn in is something that can only be called an act of putting the cart before the horse.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday announced that it has now joined Project Nexus with the four ASEAN countries to create a platform to facilitate instantaneous cross-border retail payments.
"Nexus, conceptualised by the Innovation Hub of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), aims to connect India’s UPI (Unified Payments Interface), with the fast payment systems of ASEAN members -- Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. These four countries and India would be the founding members and first-mover nations of this platform, the RBI said."
"An agreement to this effect was signed by the BIS and the central banks of the founding countries i.e., Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), Bank of Thailand (BOT), Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Reserve Bank of India on June 30, 2024, in Basel, Switzerland, according to an RBI statement."
"Indonesia, which has been involved from the early stages, continues to be involved as a special observer."
"The RBI has been collaborating bilaterally with various countries to link India’s Fast Payments System (FPS) – the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), with their respective FPSs for cross-border Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) payments."
"“While India and its partner countries can continue to benefit through such bilateral connectivity of Fast Payment Systems, a multilateral approach will provide further impetus to our efforts in expanding the international reach of Indian payment systems,” the RBI said."
"The platform can be extended to more countries, going forward. The platform is expected to go live by 2026. Once functional, Nexus will play an important role in making retail cross-border payments efficient, faster, and more cost-effective, the RBI statement added."

"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a criminal case and initiated an investigation in the NEET question paper leak case. Special teams have been formed by the CBI to investigate the matter on top priority. Special CBI teams are being sent to Patna and Godhra where local police cases have been registered. CBI has registered the FIR based on a report from the Bihar Economic Offences Unit (EOU). Sources claim that officials involved in the probe suspect that the question paper was leaked from Oasis School in Jharkhand's Hazaribagh district. According to an EOU source, a question paper with booklet number 6136488 was purportedly shared on the WhatsApp group of the 'examination mafia' in Patna. This booklet was received by the school in Hazaribagh. During the investigation, it was also found that the box in which the booklet reached the school had been tampered with. The CBI is now trying to determine whether the question paper was leaked while it was being moved to the bank, or if it was stolen somewhere mid-route between the bank and the examination center. According to a source, Sanjeev Mukhiya, an employee of Nursarai Udyan College, Nalanda, was the kingpin of the 'paper leak gang'. He has allegedly been conspiring with his associates to leak the NEET exam paper for several months. Before the exam, a professor reportedly sent the paper to Sanjeev Mukhiya on WhatsApp. The paper was then solved by PG medical students from Patna and Ranchi. After solving all the questions, it was sent to Chintu Kumar, a.k.a. Baldev, on his cellphone in the Karayparsurai block in Nalanda district. The Bihar EOU also discovered a list of selected candidates who were given the paper before the exam and were made to memorize the answers. The EOU has so far arrested 13 people in connection with the matter. Besides, many others are being questioned. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the EOU has conducted raids in Deoghar, Jharkhand, and arrested six persons, including Chintu Kumar, who is said to be a relative of the kingpin, Sanjeev Mukhiya. According to sources, the EOU has also identified the PG medical students who solved the NEET exam paper. Ten students from medical colleges in Patna and Ranchi are under its scanner. The SIT learned about the role of these PG medical students based on some WhatsApp chats with the accused individuals. The accused allegedly sent the question papers to the students on their mobile phones. Earlier, the CBI registered the FIR on Saturday night and has started the investigation. The Education Ministry summoned Nayyar Hasnain Khan, Additional Director General of Bihar's EOU, to provide information related to the paper leak. On Saturday, Khan met Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Delhi and submitted the probe reports to him. Following the recommendation of the Central government, the CBI registered the case on Saturday night. The NEET examination was held on May 5, and its question paper was made available to the 'education mafia' a day earlier, on May 4."

"A corporate employee's candid reflection on the toll of modern work culture has gone viral, highlighting the struggle to balance work and personal life. The tweet resonated with many, amassing over 313K views, as people discussed the importance of self-care and hobbies."
Depression
"In this competitive world, we often have to put our jobs ahead of everything else. We have to pay our bills, EMIs, health care, and whatnot. Our lives have become monotonous from going to work from home and vice versa so that we don’t have time for other things."
"In this corporate world, we hardly find time for vacations, going out with families, hobbies, and weekend get-togethers. Now, a corporate employee’s candid reflection on the toll of modern work culture has struck a chord with many."
"Taking to her X handle, the woman shared, “Corporate is literally taking 12 hours of my time in a day including traveling and all I do is come home and sleep. This is scary because it looks productive but it's like being a dead puppet with no hobbies or self-love.”"
"“I wake up at 6 in the morning, get ready and leave for the office by 7 30 so I can reach by 9 30, I leave office by 6 in the evening, sometimes 6 30, 7 of course, then I travel back home and reach by 9 15 something, then I eat food by 9 45/10, then I sleep by 11 bc early morning,” she further added."
corporate is literally taking 12 hours of my time in a day including traveling and all I do is come home and sleep. This is scary because it looks productive but it's like being a dead puppet with no hobbies or self love.
"Of course, her tweet went viral with more than 313K views ,13K likes and 2.5K retweets. While it struck a chord with many, others highlighted the importance of finding a hobby and focusing on self-love."
"“It's very weird kind of toxicity I've noticed in corporate. Even the people who had hobbies slowly sip into the cycle of corporate and lose touch with everything they resonated with. And, it's addictive,” commented a user.               Another user shared, “That's true, that is why being financially independent is never actually about the money, it's about freedom, freedom of one's time. Achievement of financial independence through just a job is a bit of a difficult task.”"
"“That’s where I am at. I come home so exhausted and without any energy to partake in my hobbies. Self-care is just curling up in bed, at this point,” shared another user."

"The first video shows a woman and her son sitting on the bench while a black bear gorges on the food on the table. Without being worried about the humans' presence, the beast enjoys the food. Meanwhile l, the woman sits still while covering her son's face. After clearing off the food from the table, the bear walks forward towards another woman, who also sits still without any movement and without bothering the beast. The bear steps down from the table and walks into the wild. The video has been viewed by over 17.9 million users and garnered over 58K likes."

"The second video shows a group of people with a huge bear. While everyone can be seen sitting without any worries, one of them didn't miss the chance to click selfies with the bear sitting close to it. Surprisingly, a youth brings some brown bread and a jar of peanut butter to the bear. As he starts applying the butter to the bread, he instructs the bear to have patience. He also hand-feeds the bear without any fear. Well, this is something unbelievably daring. Even more people join the party. The video has been viewed by over 16 million users and liked by 165K people."

"While the origin of the video couldn't be verified, all the videos have been shared on X by Nature is Amazing. While the situations in all three videos are different, they show that bears aren't cruel and aggressive all the time. These beasts can be gentle and harmless to humans unless provoked. Though netizens have expressed their shock over the human-bear encounters, many have opined that these beasts are gentle and harmless, though it is required to adhere to the precautions."

The BJD took a swipe at the BJP over its poll-time promise to waive off 300 units of electricity. The BJP countered by highlighting their solar panel subsidy plan.
Manmohan Samal and Pratap Deb
The Opposition BJD on Monday launched a fierce attack on the ruling BJP over its poll-time promise to waive of 300 units of electricity from July 5.
"BJD MLA Pratap Deb said, “Before the general elections, we promised in our manifesto that consumers won’t have to pay electricity bills for the first 100 units from July 1. If voted to power, our Chief Minister would sign it first. At that time, the BJP also told that they would waive off 300 units from July 5.”"

"“Today is July 1. We hope the government will keep its promise. They should not renege on their promise,” said Deb."
"In response to the BJD’s statement, BJP state president Manmohan Samal said, “I don’t know whether he has read our ‘Sankalp Patra’ properly or not. In our ‘Sankalp Patra’, we said our government would provide a subsidy of Rs 75,000 to consumers to install solar panels on their rooftops. They (consumers) would use the generated electricity for free. If they have any surplus electricity, the government would buy that. For your clarification, PM Modi always walks the talk.”"
"The state government will implement it after the Union budget, the BJP said."
